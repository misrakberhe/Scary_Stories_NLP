       "**Day 1**\\n\\nI suppose a journal is a better way than any to pass the two weeks I’m going to have to spend here alone. Of course, I’m not completely alone; everyone else was moved to the same building and locked in their own apartment, including a couple across the hallway and a lovely older woman, Mrs Ackery, next door. Oh, how I feel for poor Mrs Ackery, being old and so vulnerable during these turbulent times. I really can’t take for granted how lucky I am to have my life spared from the increased threat of death this virus poses to the cherished elderly.\\n\\nTwo men in protective suits came this morning to ensure I was comfortable and reminded me that a precautionary team will be ready and waiting downstairs in the foyer in case of any emergencies. I obviously said nothing to create a scene, though I will admit I scoffed to myself at the measures exercised, and all because of one returned resident who caught this virus overseas. However, someone as kind as Mrs Ackery is reason enough, for me, to accept my precautionary quarantine in a new temporary home.\\n\\n**Day 2**\\n\\nI certainly did not anticipate how tired I would be after a day of doing nothing! I must remember to be more aware of myself, as I collapsed onto the mattress with such force that I swear I must have snapped the darned thing! I jest, of course, though I do know I slept undisturbed for many hours, like a large boulder sunken beneath the crashing, yet calming, waves. \\n\\nIt was unfortunate that when I did awake, I could overhear yelling that spawned from the couple’s apartment across the hall. As a self-proclaimed gentleman, I exerted my greatest efforts to simply mind my own business, though a sublime combination of the couple’s exuberant voices, and not having anything better to do, myself, I simply could not help but hear a large portion of the presumed ordeal. I could not make out many words, though a loud and sudden thud brought finality to the couple’s topic. I am not ignorant to certain trials men and women in relationships may face, particularly when there is no escape from one another, though the passing of a mere 24 hours before the first fight is a noticeable effort, one cannot deny. \\n\\nI have heard no noise from Mrs Ackery’s apartment, though, to be fair, I do not suppose I have made much noise myself. Perhaps if I was joined by a member of the opposite sex, I too, could contribute such vibrant sounds to the building.\\n\\n**Day 3**\\n\\nSlept, as some say, like a baby, again, last night. All was still and silent when I awoke, granting me a peaceful morning of absorbing the sunshine with a hot tea. My mood was slightly soured by my stumble over a small, dense tube that had protruded through an accurately measured hole by the locked entrance. I have not noticed neither the tube nor the hole before, though I confess I have not been actively looking for it these past few days. \\n\\nRegardless, I yanked it out and marvelled at its astonishing shortness; it battled to reach a few inches, the poor thing. I talk as if this softly thick tube has emotions or consciousness. I did submit down to the floor on my hands and knees to curiously look down the hole, though all I could see was black. Such a shame, I think. I really have nothing to do. I left the tube out on the kitchen table, so I may have something new to toy with while I waste away my days in here; I have grown tired of the very look and being of the three pens on the study’s desk. It is now late, and I shall try to sleep.\\n\\n**Day 4**\\n\\nOh, what a miserable night of sleep. No, actually, what a miserable night of no sleep. The darkness was void of refuge for me. My eyes were peeled open and fixed on the ceiling above me longer than they were shut last night, rewarding me with not a moment’s rest. It started hardly 10 minutes after I packed away my journal and started for sleep, when I began hearing the first noises I had heard from Mrs Ackery’s apartment. There were groans and moans, longing for…something. I don’t know what! Sometimes there would be pauses between her pitiful screeches before a great cry of pain and anguish surmounted beyond the walls. \\n\\nI gripped myself tight and shuddered at the thoughts that came upon me as my mind wandered through the countless dreadful possibilities that may have been befalling poor Mrs Ackery while I just sat and listened, stunned by fright. Though it is now morning and my shock has somewhat passed, I remain rattled to my bony core. I can only hope and pray that tonight shall bring me an unknowing peace so I may not have to endure such torment again. \\n\\n**Day 5**\\n\\nOh, pity me. The peace of sleep escaped me once again last night, and once more, I was forced to endure the horrid sounds that came from that awful woman next door. Curse her and the grief she brings upon me! My sharpened edge chooses to remain with me, even in daylight of morning. Before, the sun brought reprieve, now it does no such thing. I am left with no option but to compose a letter for the group downstairs in the foyer, brimming with many complaints and worries for Mrs Ackery next door. God, I have nothing else to do. I hope this brings welcome change. I can’t last nine more days of such grief.\\n\\n**Later**\\n\\nAround noon I used an establish communication system to deliver a letter to the foyer. I wrote to alert them of Mrs Ackery’s unceasing audible concerns, as well as my own reflective concern of her wellbeing. Shortly after, I heard footsteps travel the corridor and stop, presumably, outside Mrs Ackery’s apartment. \\n\\nI stood at my door and pressed the side of my head to it, listening for anything that could aid in my own personal query. There was a knock, then after a moment, the door to Mrs Ackery’s apartment opened. There were but a few murmurs from two different people as footsteps wandered the room before leaving a minute or two later. I stepped back from the door, slightly defeated, I admit. \\n\\nThe solemnity of my mood did not acquaint with my body long, though, as it was quickly replaced by curiosity, then a shred of fear. The footsteps began moving from Mrs Ackery’s apartment and toward mine. The steps were oh so very heavy and slow, as if they were aiming to maintain my unknowing, though it were too late for that. I cautiously retreated back a few steps and waited in silence, listening for when the leaden footsteps reached my own door. They did. \\n\\nIn a moment of perhaps stupidity or crazed panic, I yelled out to them. “Did you see Mrs Ackery?” There was no response, so I continued again. “How was she?” Again, nothing. I stepped closer to my own door and knocked. If it weren’t for the peculiarity of the situation, I perhaps would have laughed at the scene of knocking on a door from the inside. Such thoughts quickly abandoned me, though, as the slightest tapping sensation began on my toe, like if a wood pecker chipped away at a wooden stump with a beak of cloud. \\n\\nI looked down to see what could be causing such an odd sensation, only to see another tube, most similar to the one that already sat on my kitchen table, poking through the same hole by the apartment door. In a moment of weakness, I uttered an expletive as I jumped back slightly, causing the tube to retract back through the hole. My intrigue was sparked and I wondered where the tube had gone. God, how much my curiosity curses me. Like I had done before, I returned to my hands and knees to inspect the hole by the door. Good grief, what a fright I received. \\n\\nI slid forward my face and glared deep into the dark tunnel. It was nothing but black, again. I was almost ready to return to my feet when slits and shivers of light began seeping through the opposite end of the hole. All in one motion, a circular cover that blocked the small tunnel’s other end swung open from a hook and revealed one peering eye, glaring right back at my own. \\n\\nThe scare made me jump back, knocking two chairs and a table that sat behind me. I immediately returned to my room and shut the door with force. Now here I lie in bed, writing to calm myself and ease my shaking nerves.\\n\\n**Day 9**\\n\\nOh, how bored senseless I have become, yet how curious I simultaneously have grown. The first three nights after I sent for the men to enter Mrs Ackery’s apartment rewarded me with full nights of unbroken sleep and good rest. Just yesterday, though, I again found a protruding tube, just like the one that sits on my kitchen table and the one that was tapping my foot some days ago, sticking out of the small tunnel by the front door. What is the case with these strange things? \\n\\nI grow more confused and unknowing with each sleepless night, as just last night, after removing the tube once again, I had a new evening of woeful screams that again came from Mrs Ackery’s room. I grew deathly frightened at the recurring sounds, which were now joined by tingling slurps and chomps, as if a beast roamed her room. Oh, good and merciful God, why must I endure these uncertain times? I have heard nothing from the couple across the hall since…some time, at least. I shall write another letter to the people in the foyer, in dire hope that my conscious can be put to ease. What could they possibly explain that would change anything? What explanation is there for the noises I hear coming from Mrs Ackery’s room at night? \\n\\nGod, may your unforgiving grace of sleep’s passing sweep not forget me tonight.\\n\\n**Day 10**\\n\\nWhat a poignant 24 hours. I slept for not one blink, which I am beginning to grow accustom to, though I heard no noise from Mrs Ackery’s room. My relief is spoilt by an undeniable sense of fear and uncertainty, as I find myself perhaps longing for the normality of the grotesque sounds that once occupied my nights. The silence was off-putting. \\n\\nI wrote many more times to the foyer to no avail. This mystery is certainly driving me mad. I fear that if I fail to gain some aspect of control over the situation, I will not live to see the end to all this.\\n\\n**Day 11**\\n\\nIt is just a bit past midnight. I am awake in bed again, and just like the night before, no noise was making its way to me from Mrs Ackery’s apartment. Oh, God, did I ever dream of finding myself longing for the return of the sounds that used to fill my sleepless nights? Footsteps in the hallway quickly pierced the silence like a shot bullet, and I suppose I must have been already quite on edge, as I sat up instantly at the pacing bumps. \\n\\nThrough my ajar bedroom door, I maintained a fixed stare on the apartment’s front door as I heard the steps grow louder. A part of me wondered if it was the people from the foyer here to check on Mrs Ackery like I had asked, but what an odd time it would have been to do so. I expected, from past experience, that they would come during the day. This thought was quickly dismissed as the steps continued past Mrs Ackery’s door and toward my own. My face flushed with buzzing heat as they stopped at my front door, and in the pitch black, slowly unbuckled the lock on the one plank of a door that protected me from the contents of the hallway. \\n\\nOh, God, how fearful I was in those few moments, when a hand must have clasped the handle and slowly opened the door. The shrieking creak split my very soul, and pierced deep within my ears. I hopelessly awaited for someone to enter, though no one did. The door just sat there, open, but hardly pushed forward. I was quite honestly perplexed and dumbfounded at the experience of such immense and instinctive fear remaining present so long after the event had transpired. I did not dare move from the bed to investigate as I did not hear the footsteps depart from the door. \\n\\nHow could I even begin to think of falling asleep now? I suspect my wake will linger the remaining night, as will my gaze on the open door. I write in the dark now, awaiting daybreak, or death.\\n\\n**Day 12**\\n\\nI must have dozed off as I awoke in the late morning to a beam of light hitting my eyes. For a moment, I maintained an ignorant bliss of my dreadful reality, though upon my coming to, I wasted not a moment in hesitation before moving to inspect the front door. I did not even make it there, however, as a different discovery, a far more haunting one, stopped me on my way. I had pushed my bedroom door completely open, and found one of the kitchen chairs had been turned from the table to face my bedroom through the open door. \\n\\nThe sight brought a chill upon my body. Someone had been watching me sleep last night. I had no idea who it was or where they were now. Can one truly grasp such a thought as being at one’s will in such a state of vulnerability? I thought it best not to dwell on the situation, and instead, better to give my all to the cause of escaping this hell. I didn’t care about the damned quarantine anymore. The front door was as open as I saw it last night, meaning whoever, or whatever, was careful to position it so upon their departure, or…no, I should not dwell on such things. \\n\\nI widened the front door of the apartment to allow myself the room to jump out in a crazed blaze. I did so, and found it to be empty. I saw the door to Mrs Ackery’s room, but was first captured by another unlocked and open door facing me. It led to the couple’s apartment. Abandoning all care, I pushed the door open and moved inside, but something felt off. I moved toward the kitchen, which was an exact replica of the one in my apartment, though the place seemed deserted. I even called out “Hello?” to no response. \\n\\nI then proceeded to the bedroom door, which I found shut. The very embodiment of fear birthed inside me. I shook my head to myself as I stepped to open the door with the light click of the twisted handle. How I mustered the courage, I will not ever know, though I suppose lack of other options sufficed. How much worse for myself I made the process by opening the door with a slow carefulness, allowing the same drawn-out creak to fill the room. I shudder at the thought of that sound, more than I did at the abhorrent noises that used to spawn from Mrs Ackery’s room all those nights ago. God, how long ago that feels, and how much I wish to return to the simplicity of such ignorance and naivety. \\n\\nI found the bedroom, like the rest of the apartment, deserted, though the sheets from the bed had been taken, where I do not know. I do not suppose I know what I planned to have done if I did not find the bedroom to be empty. The couple’s absence was reassuring in some ways as I could avoid such a scenario of conflict, though it did make the apparent disagreement I couldn’t help but overhear in those first few days more puzzling. \\n\\nRegardless, I moved on, more captivated by Mrs Ackery’s room. I noticed a presumably empty cylinder of gas, sitting beside the small metal hatch that covered the small tunnel into the apartment. In fact, upon checking, I noticed every previously or currently occupied apartment had a similar hatch, except Mrs Ackery’s. \\n\\nThe lock on the door was far from difficult to undo, as was the door. But my God, oh dear God, the things I saw in that apartment beyond that unlocked door. How I wish I could run away from time and never have done such a cruel deed. Oh how I now understand so many things, and at the same time, so few, or even less. I’d sooner lay down my own life than once again experience such things as I experienced in that apartment. Laid, in the centre of the room, was Mrs Ackery’s rotting corpse. \\n\\nThe stench took no liberty in delaying its extension to me, turning its attention to my poor soul like a feasting beast that had finished ravaging its prey. I would have returned my prior meals to the apartment floor if I had in fact eaten. Oh, rest you poor soul, Mrs Ackery. Her hair was malting and the moist skin surrounding her blackened eyes was peeling from the bone. \\n\\nRot had set in at the edges of missing chunks in her limbs. How much I saw in just a passing glimpse frightens me to my core, so I dare not imagine what damage a more extended examination would have brought upon my white spirit. God knows how long she has been dead for. I turned without a thought back out the door, closing it behind me as I did. \\n\\nI wanted to keep moving, knowing there was nothing I could do for Mrs Ackery, but clinging to the hope that I at least may get out of this alive. I took a flight of open stairs down to the foyer. Oh, God, do these troubles ever end? The foyer was empty and shut on all four corners, with no escape. A pile of letters had risen from the communication chute I had sent them through days ago when requesting a second wellness check on Mrs Ackery. \\n\\nThere was no one to be seen, not even a single corpse which I had, so unwillingly, grown accustomed to. Questions began replacing places of fear in my mind: what happened to the couple across the hall? Where did everyone go? Why was Mrs Ackery making all of those noises? Or if she has truly been dead for so long, then who *was* making those sounds that I so often heard those nights when sleep escaped me? \\n\\nNone of such questions do I have answers for. I’m sitting in the foyer as I write this entry. Awaiting rescue, or more likely death.\\n\\n**Later**\\n\\nSome time alone has granted me some clarity, though not in the form I was hoping. Still, one I will accept. I have not sighted the presence of anyone else in the building, though thuds of footsteps and the occasional voice irregularly travel from the roof above me. I do not know what will come of me in two nights. If I go searching for the creator of these noises I hear, I wonder what I will find. \\n\\nI battle over what to do. I question whether this quarantine was to protect us from this virus, or to contain it. What fate awaits me, oh, God? What purpose will this serve? I have so many questions, and I know the enlightenment of answers will likely only come to a man who is moments away from greeting their demise. Oh, how I long for such knowledge...\\n\\n**CONCLUSIVE NOTE: STAMPED AS EVIDENCE FOUND ON SCENE**\\n\\n   **- FOUND IN COAT OF ONE VICTIM: MALE, 30s, BROWN HAIR, BROWN EYES**\\n\\n   **-VICTIM FOUND IN PILE WITH MULTIPLE JANE AND JOHN DOE**\\n\\n   **-INCLUDING: NUMEROUS VOLUNTEER WORKERS, ONE ELDERLY WOMAN, ONE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, ONE MAN UNACCOUNTED FOR.**\\n\\n   **-CASE:** >!CLASSIFIED AND ONGOING!<       2\n",
       "Mum always warned me not to go too for into the bush. Not to stray from the path. Said there's the bunyip or something ridiculous. Well today I'm going to find out. I grab mum's camera I pulled earlier today and press onwards through the bush. My mosquito repellent works well enough, but their continual buzz is still annoying. I grin gleefully. My parents would have no idea I'm here. The biannual family camping trip is the perfect opportunity to disprove mum's pointless lies. The trail isn't too far away. I don't bother to mark my path, my sense of direction is excellent. There's no way I'm getting lost this afternoon. The sun is stinking hot, as always, but my hat should help. Slip slop slap and all that.\\n\\nAs I trek through the bush, I begin to think about what it is mum thinks lives here. The different aboriginal-peoples had different versions of bunyip, so maybe one of those. Possibly a Yowie, which is basically just an aboriginal-people bigfoot. A dropbear maybe, though those are mostly used to prank tourists. Stupid people. As if a Koala could possibly attack someone. There's no way they could ever do such a thing. What would they do, bark at me? I continue to move onwards, wondering. Before long, the sun is soon to set. \\n\\nDamn, the day went quickly, and I can't have traveled more than a kilometre. I'm really thirsty now, so I open my water bottle and... oh no. It's bone dry. I should probably be heading back now. I shake my head, telling myself a few more minutes couldn't hurt. I need to at least try to get a picture. As I press on, I hear a sound behind me. I turn around, half expecting to find a Yowie. Nothing. I get the feeling that I'm being watched. By many things. I slowly turn in a circle, trying to spot my onlookers. Suddenly, I hear something. A low, gutteral, growl, not of this world, followed by a shrill scream coming from somewhere near me. Terrified, I blindly crash through the bush in what I estimate to be the opposite direction. As I encounter a prickly bush of some sort, probably blackberries, I throw my hands up to protect my face. I crash into a tree, and bolt, helpless, in the other direction. It's all I can do not to scream. \\n\\nAll of a sudden, the trees stop, and I gingerly lower my hands from my face. I'm in a large clearing, one I know. There's a path through the centre not terribly well used, bit still there. I've somehow stumbled across the trail again. Oh, joy! But what is that brown lump? Fear rises in me again, and my heart starts breaking faster. I raise my camera and snap a picture. A bright light flashes. Stupid! I forgot to disable the flash! I guess I'll need it though, since the sky is rapidly darkening. I fiddle with the settings on the device, and hope I've disabled flash. Cautiously, I approach the brown lump. Why is it just lying there? Is it dead? I shoot another picture, but this time the bright flash and over the top shutter sound effect play, scattering the lump into miniature lumps. \\n\\nOf birds. Lyre birds. My fear subsides, and one of them makes the same growl as before, followed by the scream. Probably trying to scare me of. I take another couple of pictures, no longer caring about the flash or shutter, then press video. The camera starts recording, and I take another step toward the birds. One of them flairs it's wings and makes the low growl, then the scream. \\n\\nI stop recording, then head in the direction of the campsite with a spring in my step. Now I've got photographic evidence. How my Mum will react I can only imagine. She's a big believer in all that folklore nonsense. Pride rises within me as I picture her admitting defeat. I make it to the edge of the camp, and sneak into my tent. Good thing my stupid sister gets her own tent, otherwise I'd have to explain to her what I was doing outside after dark. No mossie bites, as far as I can tell. I'll know by morning. I do, however, have some scratches, which I quickly patch up with some papaya ointment I nicked from my sister, who insists on carrying it everywhere.\\n\\nI settle down to sleep, content. I'm just about to fall asleep when a worrying thought drifts into my head. What if the camera didn't save the images? It's stupid, I know, but I'm tired and paranoid. In the short seconds it turns to retrieve the camera, turn it on, then access the images, I've managed to convince myself that the files have been corrupted and all footage lost. Thankfully, the images and video are still there. I got some excellent shots, my favourite is the one where I wake the birds. Some of their eyes are just opening, but other than that they look quite peaceful. \\n\\nIt's then that an earth shattering revelation hits me. Lyre birds only mimic sounds they hear. Something had to have made that noise originally. I push the thought away, telling myself it must be a koala or something. But no koala sounds like that. And there was the scream too. If ever I needed more confirmation, my eyes fall upon the image of the waking lyrebirds. There, around the top right corner, I see a dark face, elongated canines bared, hungry eyes reflecting the light. A chill settles over me. I put away the camera, and low still for ages moments, debating whether or not to tell mum.\\nI hear a twig snap. \\nThen another. \\n\\nThen another. \\n\\nMy heart races.\\n\\n\\nA pause.\\n\\n\\nAnother snaps, just outside my tent, and I can distinctly hear heavy breathing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA low gutteral growl echoes through the night.

       "This is a story from before my time. Me and two of my friends, Jackson, and Leo, went to a ghost town 50 minutes from ours. Its was deserted for 20 years and now one talks about what happened. The only news articles that mention its existence are stories of missing kids. When we got to the middle of the town. There was a large park. \\n\\nWe set up camp and we talked about what we should do next. Thats when Jackson pulled out an Ouija board. We set up a few candles and got set to ask some questions. The first thing we asked was what happened here. This was the response. \\n\\n\"It started like any other day. I met up with my friends at the city park. We all agreed to go to the abandoned part of town. No one has gone over there since people started going missing. Even the cops stay away. We went in the dark. \\n\\nThere was a cool 12 am breeze going on. There were 5 of us, Tina, Mark, Jack, Lizzy, and me John. It was a half hour walk from the park. Once we reached the abandoned houses we saw the fence. It was 8 feet high with barbed wire. We expected this so we took the blankets out of our bags and draped them over the wire. It was an easy climb for some if the most athletic seniors. Once we were over the fence, we took out our phones and turned on the flashlight. Mark had brought his camera to record what we found. We walked around and looked in every single house that wasn't collapsed. The all look somewhat the same, rotting furniture, graffiti, and trash everywhere. \\n\\nYou could tell that no one has entered any of these in years. We couldn't see any reason that people would abandon this area until Jack noticed something. \"Hey guys, this was Janets house.\" We all remembered her Jack cousin who was one of the first to go missing. \"This is where her room was but there's no door.\" We all looked and he was right the door was simply gone. Like it was never there in the first place. Since we were planning on breaking some stuff I had brought a hammer. \\n\\nI started hitting the wall with the hammer. Once through we saw her lifeless body laying on her bed. It looked as if someone had sucked the life out of her. She still had the look upon her face of when she died. Pure unadulterated fear. What ever did this wasn't human. We all felt a chill go down our spines as we felt something watching us. I was the first to run. \\n\\nThe others followed shortly after me. Tina was the first to get over the fence followed by Mark, Lizzy, me. We all took a moment to catch our breaths as we all noticed that Jack wasn't with us. We all looked thought the fence and saw jack grabbing it. His eyes wide. Slowly he started to shrivel up. That's when we noticed the shape behind him. It was so black you couldn't make anything out. All we could tell was. It wasn't human.\\n\\n We all ran back to city park. The cops were there looking for us. By the time we got back the sun had started to rise. We were questioned on where we were and what we were doing. We told them about the monster and Jack. They didn't believe us, so we went back and Jacks body was gone. You could see small marks where is body was dragged through the dirt road. After the cops say that they didn't see anything and put us under house arrest we were stuck inside. \\n\\nAfter 3 days the others slowly stopped talking in the group chat. One after another they would just stop talking. We chalked it up to their parents deciding to take their phones. Then it happened. I woke up with an extreme chill down my spine and the feeling I wasn't alone. I tried to call for help but I couldn't talk. It was like someone took my voice. Then I saw it out of the corner of my eye. \\n\\n The same black shape that devoured Jack. I ran to my door, but there was one problem. My door was gone. Like it was never there in the first place. The monster grabbed me and slammed me on my bed. I the felt. Something penetrate my neck. Slowly I felt all my blood, organs, and life slowly seep out of my. It was the most painful thing I had ever seen. Everything went black for a moment then I woke up to a bright light. \\n\\n\"I'm in the hospital\" I thought. The I saw Tina, Lizzy, Mark, and Jack. I realized that we were all dead and waiting to be judged. And what's worse is that we unleashed a monster onto our town and no one knew where to look for our bodies.\"\\n\\nThat's when me and my friend decided that now was a good time to leave the ghost town in the middle of no where. We got back at 4 am and our parents were surprised to see us back from our camping trip so soon. We didn't tell them what happened. We all agreed to never talk about what we saw that night.

       "I walked up to the tree and stared at its stillness, wondering why it existed.\\n\\nI wasn't sure where I should put this story but I needed somewhere to store it where I could find it again.\\n\\nI had been out walking in the orchard behind my grandpa's house the previous night. I had a sleeping problem so late night walks were common. Everything just felt off that night, like something was telling me to just go home. It was a strange feeling but me being the careless person I am, I kept walking through the dark orchard.\\n\\n I found myself walking on autopilot and 15 minutes later when I looked up I didn't recognize my surroundings. I looked for the light of the house but couldn't see it, I felt frustrated at myself for having gotten lost in my mind for that long. I immediately scanned my surroundings for any landmark, nothing familiar.\\n\\n The first flash only barely caught my eye, the second one really got my attention. It appeared to be a flashing LED by a tree. I was a little confused why there would be anything other than tree's this far out in the orchard. As I walked towards it I began to notice that the tree looked a little off, the leaf's weren't blowing in the wind like the others were and it was shorter than the rest. I approached the tree and saw the flashing light attached into the tree and below the light was a small button, below the button is a label reading \"Emergency escape\".\\n\\n My curiosity getting the better of me I pressed down on the button. It didn't do anything at first, then I pressed it again with more force. I heard a *Crack* as a hatch in the tree opened up to a ladder going down a long tunnel, I couldn't see much in the dark and had to fight back the sense of curiosity that was building up. I decided I would come back tomorrow in the daylight. It wasn't long before I started to see the lights coming from that familiar porch. I opened the back door and proceeded straight to bed, feeling hit by a sudden wave of exhaustion.\\n\\nI woke up that morning, packed a bag with a flashlight, water, and a sandwich, then walked out the door. \"Where are you heading in a hurry?\" I heard a familiar voice call from behind me. I turned around to see grandpa standing in the doorframe. He looked great for being in his 70s, his hazel eyes shimmering in the morning light.\\n\\n \"I found something cool on my walk last night and wanted to check it out\" I said while walking back toward him. He took a sip of his coffee then said \"Well I won't keep you from it, stay safe and here I have been wanting to give this to you\" as he pulls out a little box from his jacket. He hands me the box, roughly the size of a mobile phone. I gave him a hug and my thanks before I opened the box and found inside the most beautiful pocket knife I had ever seen. It was engraved with my name \"Anthony Forester\" on the edge of the blade. The handle shimmered with carbon fiber patterns. I gave my grandpa a big hug, put the blade in my bag, and jogged away towards the orchard. After about 30 minutes of searching I had found the odd looking tree again, it stood there completely still like the breeze didn't affect it. I approached the hatch and got out my headlamp\\n\\nThere was a strange odor coming from the tunnel, almost sweet. I looked down and saw an endless chute going down what looked like forever. I picked up a rock resting near the tree and dropped it down the tunnel. Maybe 10 seconds go by before I hear a loud *Clang* as it echoes up. I put on my headlamp and started my way down the tunnel. \\n\\nMaybe 5 minutes goes by and as I stare down into the darkness of the tunnel, the oddness of the situation hits me. I couldn't wrap my head around why this would be here. This land had been owned by my family for generations so whatever this was it had to be extremely old. I began to see a opening of the tunnel slightly farther down. As I touch down onto the metallic floor I begin to peer around as the beam of light illuminates the room. I appeared to be in a hallway with doors lining each side.\\n\\nThe floor was a solid metallic grey, and made an echo with every step I took. I walked up to the first door on the right, it was a blue door with two words engraved on it. \"The Foresters\" it read. I guessed that maybe this was some old storage that we owned but it didn't make any sense to have it out here. I pushed down on the handle, it held firm. I tried again with more force this time, the handle went down with a click and the door creaked open.\\n\\nI stepped in and felt my world flip around. I was staring at my house, just like I had opened the front door. The T.V. was showing the news, even sunlight shown in through the windows. My brain couldn't wrap around how I was standing here. I turned around and instead of a dark hallway I was staring at my front yard. I looked back and was still staring at my living room, I did the only thing I could. \"Grandpa!\" I yelled. Nothing. I called again but got silence. I figured he had headed out to the fields and forgotten the television.\\n\\n I couldn't believe my eyes, I had been in that hallway not moments before. That's when I noticed it, there was a grey tar like substance leading up the stairs. I stopped and examined it. It smelled horrible, like something just dropped dead and rotted. It didn't look very good either, I noticed it seemed to be convulsing in a rythme almost like a heartbeat. Adrenaline taking over I grabbed the new pocket knife out of my backpack. It felt light yet sturdy, I examined it in the light for the first time. The engravement seemed to shimmer in the light.\\n\\nWith my new blade in hand I proceeded up the stairs, the stench of the tar getting stronger with each step. I began to hear an awful chewing sound once I reached the top of the staircase. It sounded like someone was chewing leather, it was the worst sound I have ever heard. I evaluated that the sound was coming from my grandpa's room, so very slowly I crept down the hallway and stopped outside his slightly ajar door. The stench was almost unbearable at this point. I slowly pushed the door open, I wish I turned around. I wish I had walked out that house and never looked back for what I saw in that room will never leave my mind. \\n\\nIt looked like a bomb had gone off, all the furniture was flung around the room. Clothes strewn across the floor, it was a disaster. Then I saw it, sitting in the corner. It had human like features but it was all wrong. Its skin was grey and it looked like it had a layer of that tar covering its body. But its worst feature by far was its face. Its eyes seemed to big for its skull, and its mouth was lined with sharp teeth. Its skin almost looked like a loosely wrapped present around his frame.\\n\\nThere I stood in the doorway of my grandpa's room watching this thing chew. Its mouth opened much wider than it should have with every chew. I watched as the tar like substance flowed from its mouth with every bite. I watched as it grabbed handfuls of clothes and broken furniture and stuffed its mouth. I ran, I ran faster than I have ever ran in my life.\\n\\nI was out the door and outside in no time at all, I didn't know where my grandpa was and I didnt care. All I could think about was getting back to that tree, back in that hallway and back inside that door. I thought I heard it chasing me but I never looked back. I don't even remember making it back down that tunnel but next thing I knew, there I was standing in front of that familiar blue door with my name engraved in it. I pushed the handle again and it opened effortlessly, I felt that familiar feeling of my world flipping and there I was holding my front door open.\\n\\nI instantly smelt bacon wafting through the house and knew that I was back. I ran into the kitchen and straight into my grandpa's arms. He had a look of confusion, \"what's gotten into you?\" He asks after I let go. I wasn't sure he would believe me so I just told him that I missed him and ran upstairs. After I got into my room I noticed I no longer had my knife. I must have dropped it in the other house, the house that felt anything but homey. As I walked towards the stairs I couldn't help but find myself lingering at grandpa's room, because I could have sworn I smelt death.

       "Hello all, my name is Henry, and recently I moved back home after my college semester had ended. I was fortunate enough to be able to move back home with my parents and enjoy the summer but the past couple of days have been particularly difficult for me and my family. I’ll start from the beginning from the first one I can remember having. \\n\\n\\nMy first premonition started when I went to the fishing pond by myself early one morning. I couldn’t wait to get there early, get a line in the water and wrestle up a nice Channel Catfish, something I’ve been dreaming of all winter. I got to the pond, set my pole up and took shelter in a nice spot of shade with my line out in the depths of the pond. A tall pine tree towered over me, leaving me tucked away in a nice little spot with the sun peering through the branches. The sun burned hot that morning and already I could feel the sweat beading on my forehead. I sat there quietly for some time, listening to the trees rustle from the slight wind, the occasional fish leaping from the water with a distinct splash and the deep ribbit of bull frogs wading in the marsh beyond the pond. \\n\\n\\nAs I gazed upon the sparkling water of the pond, the sun reflecting every ripple, every tiny disturbance on the water, the first premonition hit. It was like I was teleported into a different reality. I watched my backyard like I was in a third person perspective watching down at my dog playing along the edge of our backyard by the woods alone. Something wasn’t right, I could feel in somewhere inside me tucked away like a deep cavernous pit.  I continued watching my dog Lucky sniff the rock wall that separates our yard and a thick section of woods. Lucky snapped his head up as rustling began coming from within the woods. Soon, the hairs on Lucky’s nape were standing up and he let out a thick guttural growl. A pack of five or six coyotes jumped over the rock wall, making their whiney sounds towards Lucky. Lucky stood ground, while I begged for him to run. They stood facing each other like a western standoff, the coyotes making tiny steps closer and closer to him. The coyotes, mangy with patchy grey and dark hairs bared their teeth, with wet beads of drool dripping from their mouths. I looked on in horror as they lunged at him. Each of them taking bites and tears from him before he lay side down in a pool of his own blood while the wild animals feasted. As I watched, the dreadful feeling skyrocketed, feeling my stomach sinking, I was snapped back into my own reality with my fishing line racing off the reel. \\n\\n\\nLike a second nature I set the hook and began reeling in the fish, my mind not completely off what had just happened. I felt numb, strange as when I hook into a fish I get a bit of an adrenaline rush. I got the fish safely off the hook and back in the water rather quickly, I was focused on something else. I took some time, staring back out into the glistening water thinking about my dog. When I couldn’t calm myself down, I called my dad and asked him if Lucky was ok. Dad told me that Lucky was out back doing his business. I yelled over the phone and begged my dad to get him inside. I guess my frantic cries and pleas left my dad without much conviction. Dad called Lucky in while still on the phone with me. What he told me next sent that same dreadful feeling deep within me. He described to me as a pack of some kind of wild animals, some kind of dogs jumping out of the woods coming towards the house. Coyotes I told him deadpan, he asked how I knew that. Lucky was barking in the background I presumed at them. I told dad to keep Lucky inside and don’t let him out by himself. I hung up the phone and felt slightly better, my heart was still racing and I noticed my hand was trembling trying to hold my fishing pole. \\n\\n\\nI didn’t have much luck fishing that day, my mind was somewhere else. I was happy just to be out on the water. Taking in the fresh summer air, but I couldn’t shake that dreadful feeling. I sat by the water’s edge for some time, going over the premonition. I felt my heart start racing each time the sun reflected brightly off the water. My head began to hurt after some time, I packed up my gear and headed home. As I pulled into my driveway, still feeling that numbing sensation in my body, I looked out towards the woods where Lucky in my premonition got attacked. I focused hard and saw through the tree line. They were waiting, I could see the rises and fall of their body with each breathe they were taking. That mangy, dark and grey coat of fur and needle sharp teeth as the pack of coyotes waited in the cover of the woods. I headed inside, greeted my Lucky and my dad, not sure if I should tell him what happened at the pond. Looking back, I wish the rest of my premonitions were as simple as this one, I don’t know what to call it, fate or a warning. I just wish I was able to stop the rest of them

They both were pushing two of the old wheelchairs in front of them. The taller one pushed Jessie into a chair, who sat on the metal seat with a dull expression on her face. I looked up at the other guard, which is when I noticed the masks they were wearing, like the kind you would wear if you were deconstructing a beehive.\\n\\nBefore I could speak, I was pushed into the other chair, the force knocking the breath out of me. Before I knew it, I was being wheeled out of the room, Jessie in front of me.\\n\\nWe stopped at the double doors at the end of the hallway, which were huge and towering and covered in marks. I couldn’t get a closer look as the guards wheeled our chairs speedily through the doors and into another hallway.\\n\\nThis hallway was darker. And noisier. I realized the sound was coming from an open door on the left. I guessed right as Jessie and I were steered into the large room.\\n\\nThree round tables were spread across the room, all set with plates, cups and cutlery. The walls were painted a light red, and not a window was to be seen. The floor was wood. It smelt like burnt meat.\\n\\nI was wheeled over to a table with Jessie sitting across from me. Gingerly I got out of the wheelchair and sat onto one of the wooden chairs seated around a table. I looked up as Jessie was facing me, her hands neatly folded on top of the table.\\n\\nThe men rushed off and we sat in silence for a few minutes.\\n\\n“What is th-“I began,\\n\\n“Shh!” Jessie said, a delicate finger pressing on her lips. I made a confused face as she sat still.\\n\\nThe familiar sound of the wheelchairs came back as another patient was brought into the room. My eyes widened in surprise as I realized who it was. The Fingernails man.\\n\\nHe was directed to a seat on a nearby table by the same guard as before, and nodded his thanks to the guard, as though the interaction had happened many times before. I looked at him closely.\\n\\nHis head was still on backwards, and I could make out tiny stitches along his neck where they replaced it. I squinted and realized the skin colour of his head was darker than his arms that, like Jessie’s were neatly folded on the table in front. I looked down at my lap, horrified out of my mind.\\n\\nThey swapped someone’s body with his head.\\n\\nSoon, more patients were escorted in. By the end there were six of us. Jessie looked to the seat to the right of her, and for a moment I wondered if her dad once sat there.\\n\\nTwo patients to each table I assumed, looking around.\\n\\nFingernail Man was accompanied by an old woman with a shaved head. Her skin was as white as paper and she hadn’t spoken a word since she was brought in. As I watched her, she turned and stared at me, her intense blue eyes sending a message I didn’t need to be put into words. I looked away.\\n\\nSo, Fingernails and Blue Eyes at one table, and two more strangers at another.\\n\\nA young man, looking around my age sat confidently at the corner table. He watched the guards with concentration and seemed suspicious of the old guy on the other side of him.\\n\\nHe didn’t see me watching, as my eyes scanned over him. He had dark chocolate skin and a head of dark curly hair that was messy and unkept. He looked unharmed, just dirty and ragged. He seemed to be the type to put up a fight. I made a mental note to try and talk to him.\\n\\n“That’s Brett” Jessie whispered across the table. I slowly nodded, and then asked,\\n\\n“Do you know him?”\\n\\n“He fought off Doc once. Before my surgery, I hated medicine time. I always cried. One night, Doc was getting really mad. He looked angry. He was about to punish me, and I knew it. But before he could touch me, Brett stood in front of me and got the punch” She blushed at the memory.\\n\\nI smiled and looked back at him, as he was still watching the guards who were talking on the other side of the room.\\n\\nAcross the table from Brett was an old man. He wore an eye patch on his left eye and was foaming at the mouth. Thick brown hair like a dog covered most of his face, neck and arms. He looked like an animal experiment gone wrong.\\n\\nA bell chimed, and everyone in the room looked towards the guards. They stood in front of a dark blue door, the kind that swings both ways in a pizza shop. Seconds passed, before the Doc himself stepped out.\\n\\nHe was dressed in a grey suit. His hair was slicked back, and he was clean shaven. A proud smile on his face as he glanced at all of us.\\n\\nI swallowed, feeling his eyes bore back into mine, yet I didn’t break the contact. He dropped the smile.\\n\\n“Good evening everyone” he said, strolling into the center of the tables. He held his arms behind his back as he thought of his next words.\\n\\n“Tonight, you will feast. And tomorrow, you will play.” He said, an evil look dancing in his eyes. Goosebumps covered my arms as my instincts kicked in. Play? What is this? Some kind of game?\\n\\n“Boys let’s get this over with” The doctor declared, motioning for the guards to come over. One of the guards came out of the blue door with a metal cart, which was clattering with something inside.\\n\\nJessie let out a small whimper. I turned to her and she gave a small nod. Whatever that means.\\n\\nThe guards went to Dog Man first. He growled when they first approached, getting louder as a guard reached for his eye patch and pulled, revealing an eye missing like Jessie’s. Dog Man’s eye was fresh though, red chunky blood oozing out of the wound. One guard cleaned it, another held down the growling… man, as another filled up a long needle with bright orange liquid.\\n\\nThe guard gently inserted it into Dog Man’s arm as he howled. Much like the canine he resembled. They finished up as the old man whimpered and growled. Doc just watched it happen with a charming smile on his face.\\n\\nHe turned to Brett.\\n\\n“Your turn my friend” He said, slight sarcasm in the last word. Brett didn’t break eye contact as Doc ordered three more guards to come in, to hold Brett down.\\n\\nI looked over to Jessie who smiled.\\n\\nPart 5:

       "As a baby, I had multiple health problems. I couldn’t be outside for too long because the sun was toxic to my skin. My parents kept me inside for the entirety of the first 2 years of my life. My mother always stayed home to care for me, and my father always traveled for work. None of this really affects me now. Aside from a few chronic illnesses, I feel mostly fine, and I barely remember any of the years I was kept inside my house.\\n\\nOn my first birthday, I was alone with my mother. My father was on a plane back from Europe to celebrate with us. My mother got a phone call. The plane crashed. Only four people died. My dad was one of them. My mother became nearly bedridded. She did not leave the house at all. The only time she said she showed any happiness was when she would play with me and care for me. Again, I remember none of this. I was literally only 365 days old. I don’t remember my father at all. But in that moment, my mother’s whole world died. My family on both sides were able to help financially during this time. I still was very sick and could not even sit next to a window without getting hurt, so we needed lots of help.\\n\\nSomehow, we made it through this time, and the day after my 2nd birthday, my mother searched for job interviews in the area. It was the first grown person she’s interacted with since her husband died a year prior. She got a very nice job working at home. She made good money so she could pay for my medical bills yet still make time for me personally.\\n\\nI’m 19 now, and my mom died about a month ago. Brain Cancer. Who would’ve guessed that I would outlive both of my parents? Especially with the condition I was in when I was born. I was able to move in with other family members, and I’m feeling mostly alright.\\n\\nWell. . . almost.\\n\\nI was looking through old photos to put into a commemorative album for her at her funeral. I came across pictures she took during the year when she was alone with me. Even though I know she was always so sad at that time, she always looked so happy to be with me. The reason I’m writing this here is because I found a photo of my second birthday “party”. I put “party” in air quotes because it was just me, my mother, a cake, and that’s about it. The picture showed me and my mother sitting at one end of the table. There was a cake with a “2” candle sticking out of it on my plate. I sat in my highchair with a semi-confused expression while my mother hugged me tightly.\\n\\nThere was. . . another person in the picture. He was holding the camera back at himself and taking the picture like a selfie. He had captured the whole image. The only problem was that he had died a year before. My dead dad was taking a picture of my mother and I on my second birthday.

       "My mother used to tell me “you can always start a story with ‘It was a dark and stormy night”.  Ironically, the story I am about to tell you does not start in the dark, or in a storm, or at night for that matter. My story begins on a sunny day in the quiet, breezy woods that have become the home of legends.\\n\\nI loved hiking, it didn’t matter where, but on this particular day my wife and I were exploring the woods of northern Michigan. The sun was shining, there was a light breeze and it was just me and her doing one of our favorite past times together. We had woken up that day knowing that hiking was all we were going to do that day; our only goal was to cover as much area as we possibly could. We ate a hearty breakfast of eggs, bacon and toast, another favorite of ours. After breakfast we packed our bag with sandwiches and snacks and a few water bottles and were on the trail by 10 am.\\n\\nAs we trekked deeper into the woods, we came to a river, it was clear and the sun shining through the trees made the water gleam. This river went for a very long distance and we decided that following it was the best decision as there was no telling where we would complete our journey. By doing so we had a guide to lead us back out as well as preventing us from getting lost. We came to steep hill around 1 pm, the sun was high and warm coming through the trees, making the walk up difficult. When we reached the top we could see for miles and decided it was a good place for a rest. Just before sitting down to rest I felt a chill and looked around, it was a strange feeling, but I ignored it. Laying out a blanket we ate our lunch and just took our time soaking up the sun and feeling the little bit of breeze there was. After we finished we continued to follow the river deeper into the woods, knowing there were many secrets hidden under the vast canopy.\\n\\nThe river trickled quietly next to us as we walked in the patches of sunlight that breached the trees. We had been walking for almost two hours when I saw a large tree at the edge of the river that reminded me of the place I had proposed to my wife. I pointed to it and said “let’s sit in the shade of this tree and catch our breath.” When we were settling down for our break a broken tree branch tore open my wife’s bag. I quickly tried to patch the hole, as I didn’t want to lose anything on the hike. We sat there looking into the river for some time, when my exhaustion took over and I feel into a light sleep under the shade of that tree. When I opened my eyes I saw my wife next to me then I quickly looked at my watch. The sun was lower and over an hour had passed. Before we continued I took a long look in the clear water of the river, and noticed something. There was a strange rusty red tint to the water near the edge.\\n\\nThe hour was late so we had to move faster to complete our journey. The sunlight was now casting long shadows of the trees causing me to question the trail at times. The forest was becoming denser the deeper we got. The uneasy feeling was growing in me almost like being watched. There was no time to rest. Our haste was causing the birds to rise out of the trees and small wildlife to leave their dark hiding places under the leaves. We had walked miles and the rusty tint was still in the water, I was beginning to get worried, questioning my decision to walk next to the river. What would it mean at the end of this long walk?\\n\\nThe further we walked I started to feel like there was someone behind me watching. I said to my wife, “We need to pick up the pace!” We had already been moving fairly quickly but now we were almost at a run. As we hurried along I started to wonder “What was hiding in the dark behind us?” There was no sound and I couldn’t see movement whenever I turned around. I could feel it, feel it bearing down on me. We just kept moving. The day had started with the sun shining and the birds singing now all I could feel was the dark closing in around. This was close to carrying a weight with me. I didn’t know what to do. The hike had taken me nearly all day; I was tired and hot, hadn’t stopped for water in miles. I stumbled and fell to knees to catch my breath. I looked up and realized this was it, this was the spot. I could leave this weight right here, no more feeling that burden.\\n\\nThe sun was going down as my shovel pierced the earth where what was left of my wife would lay. With that I started my long walk back through the woods along the clear cold river.

       "(EDIT: I dont know why but half of the story is gone and I dont know why, Im fixing it)\\n\\nAs you can see at the title, I work as a space freighter pilot, I can´t tell you the exact name of the company because the would quite probably sue me for \" Spread fallacies and tarnish their perfect image \" Also, I don't want to give them free Externet advertising. Anyway, my work consists mainly in sitting on a mildly comfy chair, look an the radar screen and guide the ship in case I have to avoid a collision, in which case I simply move the ship to avoid space debries (Ice, Rock, Junk) so my work is pretty easy and very well paid if you ask me, however the flights are almost a year long so it´s also insanely tedious.\\n\\nThe \"Incident\" happened when I was getting ready to dodge the asteroid belt , I adjusted the course and went to my cabin to watch something on the Externet, fortunately the array of anntena buoys some companies have dispatched give most of the ships on the solar system perfect Externet signal, so you could imagine how grumpy I got when all my devices had a big pop up notification that had the letters \"N\" \"O\" \"S\" \"I\" \"G\" \"N\" \"A\" \"L\" in that precise order, I started to panic since Externet is the main and fastest way to contact with flight control, I tried to contact them via radio which was significantly slower but usually unfallible.\\n\\nBut not this time, I sent god knows how many distress calls, \"Flight control, this is freighter 8-8-8-6-4-4-9-0-1-4-5 Echo Charlie reporting malfunction on Externet connection\" and all of them were lost in the deep void of space with no awnser to them, there was not even static, just silence, I decided to check if the radio antena was fine, maybe it got loose or got hit by something, I made a quick diagnosis and the \"All radio systems functional\" message didn´t made me feel any better, and the diagnosis was not mistaken because it was accompanied by a live transmission of the cameras located in the hull of the ship showing that the radio antenna was perfectly fine.\\n\\nLooking closer to the images displayed on the diagnosis screen I noticed somethng a bit odd and went to the bridge to confirm it with my own eyes and indeed, asteroids, lots and lots of them, at first I thought I was flying over the asteroid belt but quickly I discarded that, the asteroids were all at the same height, none of them were above or below others, they were just rotatin in their spots without  moving which was another wierd thing about this asteroid belt, usually those big space rocks are flying all around, crashing with eachother and stuff like that, but these were perfecly still, just rotating in their spot, if that was not wierd enough that asteroid field stretched as far as the eye could see, it was like looking at the huge oceans back on earth, but this time were just space rocks.\\n\\nI was a bit confused, I was not suposed to even see asteroids for another week, let alone be flying over them, I tried to check the map but it was stuck in a loop, the same thing happened to the radar that did not even seem to detect the asteroids under the ship.  I took the opportunity to distract my mind and check if the Externet signal was back online but no, the same two words I was beggining to hate.\\n\\n\"NO SIGNAL\"\\n\\nI decided to see if maybe my ships Externet module was damaged,  I made a new diagnosis and I was speechless when a new message popd up un the diagnosis screen.\\n\\n\"Externet modem fully operational,  connection problem caused by unknown external interference\"\\n\\nI was still shuffling my options when I heard something that made my blood freeze, something or someone was knocking my ship from outside, and I said someone because the knocking was rhythmic, something that only an inteligent life form could make; \"Tap tap tap tap\" pause \"tap tap tap tap\" pause \"Tap tap tap tap\" pause \"tap tap tap tap\" pause, there was no way that an asteroid could make such rhythmic knocks, and there was no asteroids flying around that could hit the ship without causing heavy damage, I checked the radar and the map again only to find that they were still stuck in a loop, then a small beeping red Icon caught my atention, it was a security system notification

       "So guys, if I'm going to ask for your advice and want it to be worth a damn, I should let you know the background of this situation. My name is Molly I have three brothers, Shawn, Jacob, and Kenny. My brothers have nicknamed me \"Small Molly\" and later \"Smol\", \"Smolly\"/\"Smally\" or any variation of \"Smol\"/\"Small\" because I'm the second youngest and I'm also the shortest in our family at 05'3\". Kenny is the oldest at 39 and he's actually my half brother. Shawn is the 2nd oldest at 35, I'm the 2nd youngest at 29 and Jacob is the baby of the group at 25. While Shawn, Jacob and I have spent our entire childhoods together, Kenny has always been pretty removed from me and my other two brothers, as he lives with his mom, my dad's first wife, Melany. We haven't spoken much since we were little kids. Basically what happened was that Mel made up some stuff about him not paying child support and got him arrested. This actually happened twice. The second time, she had decided that Christmas Eve was the prime time to take this kind of petty vengeance on my dad for leaving her for my mom. Keep in mind this was literally 11 years after he'd left(I was 5 at the Christmas where mom called every hospital and jail looking for him.) and at this point my mom was furious and demanded that he never speak to her again and that all child support checks were made with a witness signing off on them. So naturally after this Kenny wasn't around as much. Mom sometimes let Mel bring him over for holidays as long as Mel promised to play nice, and even more rarely, she'd let Mel just drop him off to come play at our house, but as the length of time grew so did the distance between us. It became the three of us and then there was Kenny, separate and alone.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhen we were older, Shawn got his license and we tried to reconnect with Kenny now that we could go where we wanted without restriction. Though, when we called the number we knew by heart Mel answered and said she hadn't seen him for months. Turns out that Kenny had gotten himself in with a bad crowd and started doing drugs. After a while Mel had enough and told him that if he wanted to keep doing drugs he'd have to do them somewhere else. So he left. She said that the least thing he said before leaving was that he was going to go live in the woods right before telling her that she was a terrible mother. She didn't seem too upset by this and Shawn, Jacob and I talked for days about how shitty we felt about it. We even went so far as to tell our dad and ask for his help in searching for him. He came with us and we all tried, but we couldn't find him anywhere. After three months he finally called us and told us where he was. We were ecstatic, he was safe, he was alright, he was **alive**. As it turned out he'd run out of food and contacted Mel. She took him back in and it took her months before she decided to tell him anything about our last conversation or the fact that we'd spent days looking for him with Dad. Every time I think of this it makes me really side with Mom in wanting nothing to do with her. At that point he called us immediately. We talked on and off for a few months with some visits in between but it eventually tapered off as we grew into our adult selves.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe last time we had any contact was in 2002. Iiiiiit's definitely been a while. Hell, our separation is an adult now and while I still think of Kenny every so often he is clearly not a part of my thoughts like he used to be. It's a really bitter and sad thing, but that's how life works. Anyways my sad separated brother story isn't the point. It's just important to know all of this because that bit of background information paints a clear picture of just how stunned I was when I read the text below.\\n\\nKenny: 06:35 p.m.: Hey Smalls. 's been a while.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI ended up just staring at it for over a minute. To be completely honest, despite an 18 year gap in contact and a perceived coldness about it all I was really excited. Over the moon, even. You know those moments that the movies always show where the lover or the best friend from childhood or otherwise **extremely** important person in the main character's life shows back up and the whole world just sort of *stops*? That's how I felt when I saw Kenny's name on my screen with that message. I felt the whole world stop and I felt like it was going to be *just* like those movies where we reconnect for real this time and I finally get my brother back after all of this time and we'd have the bond I'd always wanted. I fooled myself into thinking that it would be like that, but it's real life. Not like in the movies, no matter how much you need it to be.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMe 05:37 p.m.: Kenny omg! I'm so happy to hear from you! How have you been?\\n\\nMe 05:37 p.m.: Ahhhhhh!! It's been way too long!!!\\n\\nKenny 05:37 p.m.: Small, I've gotten myself into a bit of a situation. I really need your help.\\n\\nMe 05:37 p.m.: I didn't even know you still had this number!!\\n\\nMe 06:38 p.m.: Wait. What do you mean 'situation'? What's going on?\\n\\nKenny: 05:38 p.m.: I need you to swing by mom's place.\\n\\nMe 05:39 p.m.: Is it still the same address?\\n\\nMe 05:41 p.m.: Ken?\\n\\nMe 05:46 p.m.: Kenny?\\n\\nMe 05:57 p.m.: Ken!! You're fucking scaring me! PLEASE RESPOND!\\n\\nMe 06:12 p.m.: Ken I'm on my way! I'm bringing Shawny and Jake!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAt this point I'd been staring at my phone non-stop for more than 30 minutes and I needed to do something, anything to figure out what was going on with Kenny and help him. So I called Shawn because that's what I do when I'm scared. I call my big brother. Shawn told me that he'd be right over and that we could go check it out together. I asked about Jake and he told me that we shouldn't bother Jake this week. Jake has been trying to get a degree in engineering and the semester is almost over so the students have a lot of testing coming up next week. He's been in a cease-contact for anything that isn't an emergency all week because of it. I felt like this pretty close to an emergency but Shawn reassured me that we can call Jake afterwards regardless of what we found. He said that if it was a true emergency he'd rather it be confirmed than disrupt Jake's studying for a false alarm and that if it was a non-emergency he'd rather lead with 'everything is okay now'. This kind of logic is why I always called Shawn first. Anyways. After we hung up the call I kept staring at my phone hoping to see something from Kenny while waiting for Shawn to arrive around 15 minutes later.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe drove directly to the last address that we knew of Mel's. The whole time we had a long conversation about our childhood and how shitty we felt about Kenny not really being allowed to be a part of it. It was really nice to have someone to talk to that understood these feelings I've been holding back. It was a relief to let go of it all after all this time, the guilt of not being around and not keeping up with the relationship, the constant worry of if he was doing drugs again, the fear of never seeing him again. Shawn felt all of it too. We shed all of our anxieties during the drive and we got there around 07:30 p.m..\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed was how dark it was. It was only 07:30 p.m. so there was still some sunlight left in the day however the house itself looked entirely dark on the inside. We could barely see anything inside and there was absolutely no movement. I looked around and noticed that the grass was more than a foot tall and that there wasn't a car in the driveway or on the side of the road. I walked over to the mailbox and found that it was filled to the brim. When I turned back around I saw Shawn was walking the parameter with his phone out like a flashlight. Suddenly he tensed up and stopped moving.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Smol?\", Shawn sounded like he was trying to whisper and yell at the same time. I started to step towards him.\\n\\n\"Yeah, Shawn. What-\"\\n\\n\"Get in the car\", he sounded a bit louder as he turned around to face me.\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"Get in the fucking car right now!\" I could see his face at this point as he was fully facing me. I'd never seen his eyes look that wild before. I'd never seen him so terrified. He started running towards the car from the house and I started running from the mail box. He threw open the door and practically dove into the car before locking it. Once I was inside he demanded I locked my door too while he started the car, he didn't even reach for his seat belt. The next 10 minutes after that was a blur of me demanding answers about it and him remaining. The remaining 30 minute ride home was painfully quiet after I gave up on trying to get anything out of him. He didn't even say goodbye when he left. Just stared hard at the road and drove away after I demanded multiple times that he text me to let me know he got home safe(I was really worried about him driving in that state). I even promised that I wouldn't pry him for more details at least until tomorrow. After I got home I spent the rest of the night texting Kenny over and over again asking about his mom and what's happening at that house and if that was even the right house anymore. He never responded. Shawn did, however, text me that he got home safely and nothing else. I kept my promise, I did not pry.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo this is where my need for advice comes in. We never found my brother, and something scared the soul out of my other brother. I have no idea what the fuck is going on. I haven't been able to sleep because I can't shut my damn brain off and I can't stop worrying about Kenny and wishing he'd text me back. At this point the only lead I have is that house but I guarantee that Shawn will not go back. Not after that, and I'm unsure if I should or not. I feel like Shawn might literally kill me if I do this and he finds out about it. But it's Kenny. He's my brother. Please someone tell me what the hell I should do here? I just want to find my brother.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: There has been an update to all of this where shit gets weird and I got some more information..

       "My grandfather passed away in 2007. He was seventy years old exactly. He was old enough to have seen the Moon landing live, all the way back in 1969. Most everyone who saw that footage was enamoured by the prospect that we as a species had made it to Luna, to a place our ancestors thought too far from our reach. Even now it fills people with a sense of wonder and awe for the solution of the impossible. My grandfather was the only man I knew who felt otherwise. A gut feeling told him that something terrible is out there in the stars, and that by landing on the Moon, we opened a door to madness. [After everything that's](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fza52h/i_work_for_nasa_and_i_know_what_we_really_saw_on/) [happened so far](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g3rpws/i_work_for_nasa_and_theres_missions_to_mars_that/), I'm inclined to believe him.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThat insanity of course wasn't on the Moon, but rather our dearest neighbour, Mars. The Roman God of War. At times I think how fitting that name has become over time. I've dug in as far as I can for answers - just the opportunity to know a little bit more is all I seeked. And I've found what I was looking for. Dear lord do I regret it, however. Before I get into that, let me catch you up on things as well as answer a few questions and comments I've received. A month ago, one of our rovers, Curiosity, encountered alien life on Mars. She is the third to do so that I knew of after Spirit and Opportunity, all of which I was here to witness for myself. Just recently I've discovered that the Soviets have not only landed spacecraft on Mars, but succeeded in doing what NASA has not: putting man on Mars.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow, let me address some comments. I've seen a few people suggesting we glass or nuke the planet, and I don't need to explain why that won't work. We can barely send rovers to Mars, let alone nuclear weapons. Furthermore, these creatures have adapted to survive on the surface, so I doubt the resulting radiation would have much effect if the Sun does nothing. We'd need a much more powerful weapon than what we have access to now. Some people have also mentioned that perhaps we are the intruders, and I don't know what to say to that. Hell, we might be to some, but they appear to have a vendetta against us specifically. Next, someone mentioned they might be building a rocket: I'm inclined to agree after what I've seen now. I can only hope they fail. I’ll explain that later. Now, with that out of the way, let me tell you what I found.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMuch to my dismay, the Soviets did a damn good job at covering up their landings. So much so that almost all of the records are lost or destroyed - almost all of them. A scarce few remain and with a bit of digging and bribery, I've gotten a look at them. Most of it is heavily redacted, apart from the centerpiece - what I was definitely happy to find. The live feed recording of the Soviet's Martian landing from 1989, audio and all. I can't upload the video as it will almost definitely attract attention - that's why I haven't uploaded anything beyond my posts - but I certainly can transcribe this for you.\\n\\nThe feed starts from the cone of the landing craft as it descends onto the Martian landscape. For a few minutes, nothing of note happens, until the door unseals and slowly opens. Out steps a man who cuts the feed, swapping it to show video and audio from his helmet, exclaiming in Russian. I don't know what exactly he said. He faces the rather impressively large pod, from which the female - Stella Zolina, if records are correct - from Journey's footage exits. She is visibly much younger, ten years younger in fact. My stomach churns thinking about how long she had been held captive there. The two begin a short exchange.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Touchdown?\" she asks.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Yes, yes! We did it! Can you hear us Commander? We're on the surface!\" the man replies with beaming enthusiasm. The woman steps aside to give room for the rest of the crew to come out. It's a rather large crew of seven people - two men who I recognized from Journey's footage are among them. Thanks to documents, I know that their names are Maxim Durov and Yakov Tselner. The six crew members gathered in a line as the camera operator showed them off one by one, admiring the dedication and heroism of his crew.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Yakov, you seeing this? I can't believe it!\" one cosmonaut, Sergei Chernov, says. Yakov - the crying man from the previous video - steps out of formation and looks around in awe. He's joined by two others.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"We're heroes! The pride and joy of millions! How could I believe it?!\" Yakov answers. The second woman - documents name her as Natiya Letova - re-enters the capsule along with Maxim and a man named by documents as Luchok Turbin. That leaves Damian Poltanov as the cameraman. The footage is mostly uneventful for the first thirty minutes or so, mostly the crew discussing their excitement and pride for the successful landing while they set up equipment and gather samples. Yakov takes a Soviet flag from the craft, and ventures with Sergei to find a place to plant it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Careful, and be back in ten. No less,\" Damian orders. Yakov chuckles and keeps walking. I can almost feel Damian roll his eyes. He steps into the pod and the next ten minutes are simply just waiting. Of course, neither Yakov nor Sergei returned.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Yakov, what's the hold up?\" Luchok asks impatiently. No response. \"Yakov? Sergei?\" Nothing but silence. \"Come in Yakov.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"This is Sergei, can you read me?\" Sergei's voice is dumbstruck, contrasting how tough it sounds otherwise. \"We found a structure.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLuchok turns to look at Damian in confusion. Natiya has no answers either - if she even noticed. \"Explain, Sergei.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"It's a cavern. Deep, can't see far into it. Yakov wouldn't listen and went down. Lost comms. Tried to follow, but it's too dark.\" There's a hint of panic in Sergei's voice. I could tell what cavern he found. I knew exactly what he was referring to. The shrine.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Fucking idiot Yakov… how did he even pass? Sergei, stay where you are. Maxim, Stella, bring him a lamp. Go find that idiot. Damian, Natiya, stay with me.\" I could agree with Luchok's ire. Even though he couldn't have known, Yakov was clearly not the brightest. Maxim and Stella pack up a few supplies before heading out. Damian gives the camera to Stella, and the two head out. The trek to Sergei felt ever familiar: the unmarked ground being filled with footsteps that would be joined by a rover's slow riding across the ground. When Sergei came into view, he waved at Maxim as the cavern was visible behind him. It confirmed my fears: it was definitely the same cavern Lander and Journey had encountered.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Hey hey. We got the lamp. Have you heard from Yakov?\" Maxim asked, setting down the lamp and looking into the hole in the surface.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Nothing man. Not even static. Idiot's probably lost by now. I told him not to go in. At least I kept the flag.\" Sergei gestured to the Soviet flag, whose pole was firmly planted into the ground. A sense of national pride filled his eyes.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"I'll stay here. Don't get lost now, and keep in touch with me or Luchok.\" Maxim moved to the flag, standing tall next to it as it flapped in the wind.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Stella with me, then? Nice.\" Sergei chuckled and glanced at Stella, who scoffed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"In your dreams Sergei,\" Stella shot him down. \"Luchok, we're at the crevice. Trench is about three meters in diameter. Maxim will stay up here while Sergei and I look for Yakov. That good Commander?\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Permission granted. Go ahead you two. Don't get lost,\" Luchok replied. With that, Sergei and Stella made their way into the cavern. Maxim held the light, leading the way while Stella followed behind him. Occasionally, she’d look down and pick up a rock or some dirt. It wasn’t until she encountered a six-sided obsidian prism that she spoke again.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“...come look at this.”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSergei turned around and walked over to her, glancing down at the rock she held in her palm. “What the hell is that?”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“Don’t know. Maxim, Luchok, can you hear us?” Stella called in but there was no reply - judging by the terrain, they were almost at the shrine. “Damn. No signal. Too far down. Heard from Yakov yet?”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“No, I haven’t heard anything from him. Let’s -” Sergei was interrupted by an ear-piercing shriek. When I first watched it, I fell back from my chair in shock. It was an incredibly loud, inhuman scream that was tinged with pain and fear. Sergei and Stella rushed down the halls to the source, when Yakov’s voice finally came in. He was screaming incoherently, violently swearing and gasping for breath before the two reached him at the shrine. Dead on the floor with yellow blood was a smaller Martian, whose head was bashed in with a rock held by Yakov.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“What… the… fuck…” Sergei didn’t even have time to ask questions before three more poked their heads into the chamber, rage visible in their eyes from the sight of one of their dead. The next few minutes were a blur. Stella made a break back the way she came while Sergei stayed to try and defend Yakov, but as the tapes from the future showed, their fight wouldn’t matter. Frantic panting started to fill the audio, drowning out the sounds of screams and fighting from the shrine. Miraculously, Stella got close enough to regain communication with Maxim, who picked up on her horrified gasping.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“What the hell is going on down there? We lost you six minutes ago, what-”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“Get back to the fucking shuttle, Maxim!” Stella demanded.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“Calm down Stella I can’t-”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“There’s something down here, now fucking move, Maxim!”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“Something?! You mean-”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“Yes, Maxim, now HURRY! They’re right behind me!” Stella looked back to see two Martians, running across the cavern’s floors on all fours, chasing her with a maddening bloodlust. A light at the end of the tunnel gave way to the surface, where Stella nearly collapsed into Maxim’s arms. Their reunion was short lived thanks to the creatures behind, which grabbed onto Stella and began dragging her back into the cave. She screamed in horror, kicking and fighting all she could, but the monsters had the upper hand - they tore into her spacesuit, trying to reach the skin beneath. I’ll give credit to the Soviets: these suits weren’t cheap, and it showed. The creatures that I had seen tear metal into shreds couldn’t make a dent in the suit.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMaxim must’ve realized things were lost when even more emerged from the cave, as he started running back towards the shuttle while the Martians gave up on trying to get to Stella’s body, simply opting to drag her back into the darkness as she screamed and begged for help. The feed cuts out then and there. I thought that was it, but when I went to stop the footage, I noticed how long it was. It was days long, and giving a cursory glance showed that most of it was black empty feed. That is, until the end of the fifth day, when the footage finally returns.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nStella is sitting in some sort of prison chamber, holding the camera in her hands, pointing it towards her face. She’s still wearing the tattered and dirty remains of her spacesuit as she weeped softly. After a few seconds, she spoke.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“This is... Stella Zolina. Aged… twenty seven. Part of the USSR’s Martian Expanse Program. I don’t know if Command is receiving this, likely not. The transmitter should still be online back at the shuttle, if the shuttle is intact that is. I… don’t know if it is or not. I’m reporting one confirmed fatality, Natiya Letova, may she rest in peace as an honour to her country. Those things… they killed her. Took her to some sort of table, strapped her down, and tore out her guts. Made us watch as their fucked up crowd cheered them on.”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“Yakov is badly injured. They’re letting us patch him up, I don’t know why. I don’t know why they’re keeping us alive. There’s air down here. It’s impossible and it shouldn’t be the case but there’s breathable air down here. I saw a couple of plants and farms on my way in. I can hear them speak sometimes, at what I assume must be night - I can’t tell down here - and it’s… hard. Their voices are a bit scratchy and range from mellow to violent. I think there’s some now, hold on…” Stella pauses, holding the camera close to the wall. I can vaguely make out the sounds of alien chatter. Their voices seemed... wrong, somehow: I don’t know how to put it, but it made me feel very uneasy. It’s difficult to describe - the best way to put the sound is a mixture between some sort of reptilian croaking and an Asian dialect.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“Ah, sorry, I’m… distracted now. I just want to go home you know? Never thought I’d get accepted for this program, and when I first got on the ship I thought this would be… something amazing, and… we did land here, we did. We’ve made it to Mars. I don’t think the inhabitants are happy about it. I don’t know if it’s because Yakov killed one. He says it attacked him first. Another thing I’ve noticed is that… every day, they take one of their own down into that first room we found, and after a few minutes, they come back without them, coated in blood. Sergei says it’s some sort of sacrificial ritual. They dragged the last one kicking and screaming. I don’t know why they’re killing their own and not us, but-” Stella is interrupted by off-camera shuffling, which prompts her to turn the camera towards the noise, showing Damian, still in his space suit but awake. Beside him is Luchok, who is tending to Yakov.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“You finally got that thing working? They need to send men up here and fucking trash the place. Shoot every single one of those fucking lizards. Those bastards deserve it after what they did to-” Damian himself is interrupted when Luchok interjects.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“Don’t be a fucking idiot Damian. You think anyone’s gonna help?” Luchok scoffs, shaking his head. It reminds me of the date of this recording. 1989. Thirty one years ago. He was right: nobody would save them. Hell, we knew about them since 1999 and we didn’t even bother to help. We just covered it up and moved on. Damian grumbles and walks towards Stella, taking a seat right next to her. He offers to hold the camera wordlessly, and she obliges, handing it over to him.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“They took Sergei and Maxim for... something. I don’t know what. They still haven’t found the ship as far as we know. When Sergei explained, we decided to abandon the ship, leading those things off course. God knows that if they found it… they’re looking for it. I think they know that it can get them to Earth. Fuck, if they find it…” Damian’s grim expression as he stared hopelessly into the camera spoke miles. The sudden recognition in his eyes gave way to sorrow. I remembered that we never saw that craft.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMovement comes from outside the cell, and Damian aims the camera to watch with him. A group of Martians march towards it, pushing Sergei and Maxim along. Damian stops breathing for a moment, the view of the camera shaking intensely.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“...Luchok, how long do the ship’s transmitters function after touchdown?” Damian asks, his voice dead set on a suicidal idea that I already knew he’d go through with.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“Eh, about a week or two tops. Why?” Luchok answers, oblivious to Damian’s idea. Stella gasps, seemingly putting two and two together.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“I’m going to get this camera to the ship and send the feed to Command. Then, I’m going to activate the launch sequence,” Damian explains his plan. Stella quietly pleads with him not to as the Martians grow closer.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“The launch sequence won’t function without the coolant tanks. It’ll blow itself apart.”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“I know.”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“...do you need us to buy you some time?” Luchok is heard getting up as well, and Stella sighs, realizing that there’s no use arguing against Damian.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“Do whatever you can do. Sergei and Maxim are smart enough to know. I can get back there easily. I’ll get this sent out so Command knows what kind of fucked up shit is down here.”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nStella and Luchok were in silent agreement. When the Martians opened the cell door, the three of them charged into them, catching all off guard. Damian made a break for it with the camera as the others did what they could to hold them back. After a short scuffle, Luchok’s pained screams echoed throughout the damp, dark corridors before it turned to eerie gurgling as I could only assume his body was defiled and ripped into endless shreds. Thankfully, Damian didn’t turn the camera back to look. He kept going through the caves, reaching the massive area Journey would encounter a decade later, then running into the farming rooms. I knew he’d make it, but the tense sounds of the creatures crawling across the halls right behind him… I don’t know how he had the courage to keep running.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nPast a familiar shrine - adorned with a Martian’s mangled corpse indicating the recent sacrifice - and into the natural formations of the cave until the distant beams of the Sun were shining through the crack in the surface. The flag of the USSR was still firmly attached to its flagpole. Damian ripped it from the ground and finally glanced behind him with the camera. He swung the pole with all of his strength as one of the Martians came to the surface, knocking them back into the others in a pile. Taking the advantage while they were down, he speared the pole through all five of them, slicing into their scaled flesh and sending their blood flying with an audible yell.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nVictorious, Damian continued his sprint towards the craft, having bought himself time. In the distance, it came into view, Damian clutching the camera tightly in his hand. I could hear more scampering behind him - they were back on track. He quickly undid the seal, pulling the hatch and climbing inside. Before he could close it, one of the Martians dived into the opening, becoming trapped with him inside. The noises outside stopped: it was clear they didn’t want to risk destroying the spacecraft. Damian swung at the monster inside of the craft, knocking them to the ground. He took a moment to show the view outside from the interior of the shuttle, before speaking one last time.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“If this thing’s still on… stay the fuck away from here, you got that?”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe feed finally ends as Damian presumably hooked up the camera to send back all of the footage it had obtained. The rest of the Soviet’s records show that the craft stopped sending any signals eight minutes later, indicating its destruction in the failed takeoff. The Soviets were dumbfounded and horrified. All of their remaining reports indicate the absolute chaos they devolved into after. Hell, it may have even contributed to the collapse of the Union for all I know - thoughts of many people believing it may be best to destroy nations to hide the truth. Whatever is the case, Russia isn’t even aware of this. Everyone assigned around that time either went into isolation, assumed new identities, or took their lives.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter I saw it… after I took it all in… I don’t know what to do anymore. The Martians are not only aware of us, they almost definitely were attempting to rebuild that spacecraft. God knows what the hell they’d do if they got here - even if we have the upper hand, who knows how many lives would be lost. Other than that, there was nothing more I could find from the Soviets. I tried looking for information from other space agencies, and there’s absolutely nothing I could find. That was until I looked back at us. Back at NASA. I mentioned earlier that it’d be impossible to just glass or nuke the planet. I stand by that statement. You see, I found out why NASA kept sending rovers to Mars. Why we keep sending things up to that planet that those creatures could just use against us. We can’t launch a nuke and hope it kills them - it’s too precise of a projection. What we can do is send something that they wouldn’t think twice about. Something that they’d unknowingly take into the heart of their people. A Trojan Horse.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nRemember back when I first decided to tell you all about this? The rover Curiosity. She’s still active. The Martians took her back into their cave, and she’s still sending feeds. They took it to *the* cave. The one that all had found before and fallen victim to. They want to show us another sacrifice. They want to show Curiosity her first and only bloodshow before they destroy her. The Martians are preparing for it. They should perform their ritual sometime next week. And Curiosity is ready. Ready to do what she was always destined to do.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI can only hope she pulls this off.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate: [FINAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gc9brv/i_work_for_nasa_and_weve_ended_life_on_mars_final/)    1\n",
       "At first, I thought it was just a regular storm. \\n\\nThe sides of our troop tent started slapping against the large metal frame. The wind howled through the encampment. Being stuck near the Persian Gulf, we had gotten used to the regular dust storms. I looked down the length of the tent and noted that the other soldiers were mostly in their bunks, sleeping, or watching movies. There was nothing else to do when the dust started blowing, especially at night. I stretched out on my bunk and attempted to fall asleep.\\n\\nJust as I was reaching the blissful edge of deep sleep the tent door slammed open and the wind screamed in as a soldier stumbled in, spitting out sand. He quickly closed the door and let out a long breath of relief. \"God fucking damn dude, nighttime sand storms are a bitch! it is a legit ass sandstorm, about couldn't find my way back\" he exclaimed. He took a deep breath and continued \"Rogers was with me but we got separated, we were not ready for a real ass sand storm.\"  He then proceeded to shake the sand out of his hair to drive his point home. I sat up and immediately pulled on my trousers and boots. \"Rogers is probably smoking a whole pack in a bunker somewhere\" came a reply from further down the bay.\\n\\n\"We have to go find his dumbass though.\" I pointed out, \"imagine First Sergeant's reaction when he finds out that we never went to look for that tard\". \\n\\n\"Shit, you right Sarge.\"\\n\\n\"Ok,\" I said, \"six of us will go looking for him, we will split into three groups. Make sure you stay together. Washington and Otwell take the north side of the camp. Martin and Smith, you'll take the east and southeast of the base. Myself and  Sergo will take the west and southwest. Make sure you cover up and spend no more than thirty minutes looking for him. He's either riding out the storm in a porta- shitter or he's in another unit's tent just chilling...good luck.\" I wrapped my shemagh around my head, grabbed my headlamp, and opened the door.\\n\\nI was greeted with hot dusty wind and complete darkness. I pressed out past the shelter of the tent and looked back to make sure everyone was doing as they were told. The sand instantly tore at my exposed arms. I could feel the sand batter my chest and back through my shirt. I regretted not grabbing my uniform top but didn't want to waste any more time. Holding my headlamp in my hand as a flashlight I continued forward into the wind. My light barely penetrated the wall of flying sand I was forcing my way through. The wind made breathing difficult even with my face wrapped. The sand made its way into my eyes despite my best efforts to shield them. Behind me, I could hear Sergo yell fuck as the sand punished his flesh. Above us, the purple hue of lightning flashed and thunder tore through the sky with enough force to vibrate the ground. with the sand came the wet splats of rain being driven sideways. It was starting to rain mud. \\n\\nJust as my shirt started to cling to my torso, Sergo's light illuminated the edge of a bunker. We hurried into the limited shelter that the concrete structure provided. Sergo cussed and carefully clawed the goggles he was fortunate to have from his face. I could feel the sand scratching my eyes as I blinked. An involuntary tear ran down my sandblasted face. \"Fucking shit\" sighed Sergo, \"it's only been like three hundred meters, feels like three miles though.\" Rain slapped the outside of the bunker and the air smelled of wet dust and cheap cigs. I coughed and nodded my agreement and made a suggestion about punching Rogers in the dick if we found him. Lightning flashed and illuminated the piles of sand, spray-painted dicks, and cigarette butts littered all around the inside of the bunker. Sergo put his goggles back in place we headed back out into the storm. \\n\\nOnce again we found ourselves oppressed by complete darkness. The wind started blowing even harder. An angry howling assaulted our ears as the wind tore across the land and over our perimeter. Lightning flashed again and in the brief glow, I could see a large troop tent rip open. The interior lights started fashing as sand blew in and filled everything. Soldiers rushed out into the darkness to find new shelter. Sergo and I ran forward and attempted to ask about Rogers. One soldier stopped and yelled that he didn't know Rogers. The troops scattered into the surrounding tents and we pressed back out to the bunkers to finish checking them. We needed to make sure he wasn't hiding in a bunker before we checked the safety of the tents. \\n\\nAs soon as we found the next bunker we ran inside to catch our breaths. Our lights had instantly found Rogers, his legs missing, and a wide trail of red sand leading out the opposite side.  \"WHAT THE FUCK!\" screamed Sergo. I let out a scream of my own and felt weak in the knees. We had found rogers brutally dead. We ran back out into the gale and our vision was assaulted by a massive explosion. The concussion slammed into me and knocked the wind out of me. Gasping for air I fell to my knees, a terrible grinding roar drowned out the wind. lightning flashed again and I was thrown sideways as a nearby generator was struck with the blinding energy. Before the rain and sand extinguished the flames I could see a massive shadow move. The orange flickering glow chased the shadow away from itself. I saw its massive shoulder towering above the camp. I felt the ground shake as it moved. I thought about Sergo and started to frantically shine my light around. I saw him lying on the ground not far from me. His throat opened to the world by a large piece of shrapnel. \\n\\nSuppressing my cries I forced myself to get up and drag his body back into the bunker. I blinked the sand out of my eyes and removed my shemagh. I tried to use it as a bandage before I realized that Sergo was dead. I left the wet sandy cloth draped over his face and stepped back out into the Hellscape. \\n\\nI could see more exposed lights flickers in torn tents. I ran forward toward where I thought my tent was located. The sand filled my unprotected ears and mouth. More lightning illuminated the sky, in the flash I could see a massive creature trudging along slowly. It appeared to be walking away from the base. Another flash of lightning made the gigantic thing seem much, much closer. The ground shook with an earthquake-like force and then the fuel tanks burst into flame. The shockwave sent me flying, I felt myself slam into something hard and darkness enveloped me.\\n\\n\\nHands, I was being shaken by hands.\\n\\nVoices, I could hear voices but I couldn't comprehend.\\n\\nFinally, I woke up to a crystal clear night sky. The moon was bright enough to light up the entire base. My entire body throbbed in pain and I tried to blink the sand from my eyes. Each movement of my eyelids brought fresh pain and the sand grated against my eyeballs. \"Careful now\" came the voice. \"you're probably feeling like pure shit man, you're definitely injured.\" \\n\\n\"What happened?\" I asked.\\n\\nThe medic took a look around before answering. \"Fucking tornado and a freak electrical storm. It took out most of the towers, a lot of tents, and cost us some generators and our fuel point. A few soldiers didn't survive the night. Looks like you were caught in the fuel point explosion. We have MEDEVAC and QRF on the way though. You'll be at a proper medical facility before morning.\"\\n\\n\"Where are my men? Where is Hotel company at?\" I inquired. The medic put his hand on my shoulder and gave me a reassuring squeeze. \"Everyone has been accounted for, everyone. Now hang on, I need to check on the rest of the wounded.\\n\\nThe helicopters and trucks arrived, all of the wounded soldiers were evacuated. I spent a week in the hospital with several broken bones. My leadership checked in on me every day. We talked about Rogers and Sergo. I learned that only Otwell and myself survived looking for Rogers. I also learned that thirty-three additional soldiers had died from either the tornado or the explosions. They tried to assure me that I wasn't to be blamed for the loss of Washington, Martin, Smith, and Sergo. I still had survivors guilt.\\n\\nI never mentioned the shadow in the storm, I don't know if I even saw it.\\n\\nTwo months later I was boarding a plane for the USA, our mission had ended the night the storm destroyed our base. The plane passed over the Gulf. I looked out the window and marveled at how the clouds seemed to dance with their own shadows on the glass-smooth ocean. One of the larger cloud shadows moved then. Its mass rippled beneath the waves and it disappeared from view.\\n\\nI gasped, I knew then that I had actually seen a creature in the storm. I thought of my friends, the soldiers who had died that night.\\n\\nThe plane flew from the day and into the night.



       "\\n\\n\\nIt was January, and it was somewhat chilly. I was in a interesting girl scout group. We were very spiritual people and believed in ghost and demons. Everytime we went camping on Saturday night something happened to one of the girls in the troop. It happened so often that it eventually became a tradition. \\n\\nOn the first camping trip it was normal enough. When we arrived their was a highschool campfire party going on near the site that we were at and that created a lot of chaos. Other then that the night went by smoothly. I was in a tent with these two girls, I didn't really know them well. And they didnt really like me.\\n\\nThe next day started off normal, nothing weird was going on. We went kayaking and stuff. Then our troop leader had us picking up trash because the camp was letting us stay their free and all they asked from us was to clean up extra trash. After that my troop leader told me and these two other girls to go get fire wood. While we were collecting it we got on the topic of ghost. I explained the them how I was a sensitive and could talk to ghost. They believed me because well I wasn't lying or anything. One of the girls were in my tent and was talking to the other girl about it. I suddenly got this eerie feeling, like someone was watching me. That's when I saw her, a little girl. Pale, scrawny, muddy and she held a raggedy teddy bear in her hand. And behind her there was a women's shadow, lurking.\\n\\nThen out of nowhere one of the girls asked me if I see a little girl over in the trees. My heart dropped.\\n\"You see her too?\" The girl from my tent asked\\n\\nWe both nodded and then I started sensing another spirit. It felt wrong in a way.  The spirit of the shadow started talking to me. Telling me how she was in a abusive relationship with her husband and he beat her to death, killing her and the unborn child in her womb.  Absolutely mortified, I went back to the other girls who were surrounding this purple swing.\\n\\nThey were talking about the little girl and her mother.   Some of the older girls didnt believe me when I said that I was a medium. While they were doubting my abilities, the woman faintly whispered in my ear that one of the girls mother had a miscarriage. She said that she knew that because since she had a miscarriage at one point of her life, she could tell. Call it her little super power if you will. I announced to the troop what the woman had told me.The girl in my tent started crying and fled, refusing to talk to anyone but her mom. Her friends went to make sure she was okay but I stayed behind, needing some time to myself. Something about the lady ghost didn't feel right to me.  Something was off, and I kept pressing her with questions. Having going back and forth with her, she admitted that she had an abortion not a miscarriage. Which is totally fine, I have nothing wrong with it except she lied to us and her husband about it. I ran to the girls and told them what I had found out.\\n\\nWe were all furious that she tricked us like that. We also realized that the little girl was trapped because of the lady. We tried to confront her but the lady started hiding behind the trees refusing to talk to us. Finally she said that she will meet up with us at the benches at 12am.\\n\\nOne of the girls explained to me that she was only allowed to be on one side of the bench because she was unable to go to the other side. Something about a barrier being there. I of course volunteered to go with them, to meet her and confront her but let me tell you I was scared.\\n\\nIt finally struck 12 am and I was skeptical and scared to go face whatever this thing was. It was mid winter and I was breathing in the cold air. The other girls were ready to face whatever this thing was, they had alot of experience with this. Don't get me wrong I have too but something about it still makes my stomache queasy. It makes me feel uneasy but I find some sick thrill to it when it's over. Another story I can tell, another experience I can use to prove my knowledge. \\n\\nWe arrived at the bench and sat on the side facing the forrest. I could sense the women but I couldn't see her. One of the girls scoffed and called her out for being a coward. Taunting her, making sure she would be angry ane come out. Then I finally saw her, peeking her head out from behind a tree. Her deluted grey eyes stared right into my own. She simply just smiled at me, it was an evil grin. A taunting grin. She knew I was afraid, she was feeding off of me. I gulped hard and tried to get my heart rate down. She couldn't do anything to me, right? Atleast i thought so, all these thoughts were churning through my head. I'm an overthinker and when I overthink about things, it gives me anxiety. Anxiety leads fear. I realized what she was doing, I was angry at myself for falling into her trap, giving her more energy.\\n\\nI joined in with the girls that was taunting her, calling her scared and weak. Telling her to come out and face us. I refuse to have a weak little ghost get the best of me. She then told us that she wasn't coming out. So one of the girls stood up and went to the other side of the bench. The side that wasn't protected. This made her furious, she didn't want us on her side. Letting us over their and mocking her. Mocking her on her territory. She stepped out behind the trees, limping. A part of me felt pity for her, I mean she got beaten to death by her husband, that's a pretty gruesome death. Then I thought of all the things she has done to us. The girl she made cry, the baby who she took the life of. I had to keep reminding myself she was a bad person.\\n\\nShe was creeping closer and closer to us. The closer she, the more of her i saw. Her body was veiny white, covered in bruises. I noticed that her scalp was ripped open, I cringed at the sight. Her nose was crooked and her lips were busted. Her limping is what chilled me the most. Her legs were mangled, bending in places they shouldn't be.  She was about 5 feet away from the benches when she stopped and looked me dead in the eye. Her eyes I realized were milky, they had changed colors. I was utterly confused but mostly scared. Why out of all the girls was she staring at me? Most importantly what did this mean for me in the future? I wanted to look away but I was deadlocked, I had to keep staring at her. She started grinning again, that damn creepy grin. I look at her more intensely. She was trying to tell me I was going to lose, that I was weak. I couldn't lose, I knew for a fact that if I lost the worst would happen. So I continued to stare. The girls voices were lingering around me but I could hear any of them. The staring continued to go on forever. Then she stopped and whispered, \"he's coming for you\" and vanished into the night. \\n\\nI snapped back to reality, what had she meant by that? The girls were freaking out asking me what happened, I wad confused.\\n\"What do you mean what happened?\"\\n\"You were spacing out and you looked pretty lifeless. You had us worrying\" \\n\\nI froze in fear realizing something, I was the only one who saw her. That message was specifically for me. This isn't the end of it, I knew that for sure at the time and I know it today. There will never be a end. Only in death, when it claims me, will I be done.

       "**\"10.\"**\\n\\nAli shouted, his voice muffled, yet somehow reverberating in the spacious living room as he stood facing a corner near the plush mahogany sofa, his bony hands covering his eyes. Giggling and whispering, the rest of us dashed away from him, scrambling to find places to hide in. \\n\\nFollowing two other kids, I bolted up the granite stairs that wound their way up to a smooth marbled landing lit up by dull orange rays of the late evening sun that spilled in through the arched skylight. Eyes darting side to side, I wondered where I should go next... An idea solidified in my brain, making me grin. \\n\\n**\"9.\"** \\n\\nThe other two went right, and I went left, bolting down the narrow and dimly lit hallway lined by doors on either side, some shut, some left ajar and others veiled by embroidered curtains. I ignored them all. I knew where I wanted to go. \\n\\n**\"8.\"**\\n\\nI spotted the door at the end of the hallway, halfway open with its hinges resting on a strong wall that separated the inside from the outside. Skidding to a halt right outside it, I quickly shot a glance behind me, soothing my irrational fear of being followed by Ali and then ducked into his bedroom, where some of us had spent hours playing video games. \\n\\n**\"7.\"**\\n\\nThe room was dark, with the only source of illumination being the weak lights of the hallway that crept in with great hesitation, pushing back the darkness by a couple of feet or so. That was fine with me, as it would only make it harder for Ali to find me. I blinked, my pupils dilating and my vision slowly adjusting to the dark. The darkness was overwhelming, and I could barely make out the silhouette of a wooden chair next to a desk with presumably a computer perched atop it. With effort that was herculean for an 11 year old kid, I dragged the chair and pushed it against the wall next to the television. \\n\\n**\"6.\"** \\n\\nI stepped on the chair, using it as leverage to pull myself up on top of the concrete ledge above the TV, and curled up into a ball to avoid knocking off the pots and framed pictures decorating the elevated space. Sweat dripping down my brow and my heart *thunking* agaist my chest, I waited with bated breath for the hunt to begin. Soon enough, he was going to saunter through these hallways, yelling out \"I spy\" at our friends, his youthful and slightly rustic accent making the words sound like \"ice-spice.\" He was going to be so terrified when he finds me, that is if he manages to find me at all. \\n\\n**\"5.\"** \\n\\nHis voice was faint, distant and barely audible. I had to strain my ears to actually listen to him. I was concentrating so hard on him that I completely missed the stench that slowly spread across the room, until it stung my nostrils like pepper. It reeked something bad, like roadkill, or dead rats rotting in the crawlspace beneath the floorboards. I scrunched my nose at the invasive smell, wondering what in the world was stinking so bad when I heard this rapid, raspy and rhythmic sound somewhere close to me. It took me a moment to understand what it was that I was hearing, but my heart skipped a beat when I finally did.\\n\\nIn. Out...\\n\\nIn. Out...\\n\\nSomeone else was breathing in this room. \\n\\n**\"4.\"**\\n\\nMy body froze in terror. Who else was in here with me? Did some other kid choose to hide here? Impossible, I would have surely noticed them running into the room. What, then? There shouldn't be anyone else in the house, Ali's parents and sister were all supposed to be out. Maybe it was a cat or something.\\n\\nPlease be a cat. \\n\\nPlease be a cat. \\n\\nSomething fell on the floor with a resounding crash, making me jump in fear. It was a pot, placed close to my feet, shattering on impact as it kissed the floor, splattering it with mud and cracked clay. \\n\\nI. Didn't. Touch. It. \\n\\nThen who did? The answer came to me as warm, wet air on my toes. Whoever was in here with me was breathing on the soles of my feet.\\n\\nI yelped and pulled my legs up, hugging them close to my chest, the action tilting my head, making me look at the space where my feet had been. I spotted a dark shape, blacker than the darkness shrouding the room. It was too long, too big, almost spilling over the ledge as it started stalking me. I clenched my eyes shut, but not before I saw glowing little orbs glaring back at me.\\n\\n**\"3.\"** \\n\\nShutting my eyes only made it worse, as it heightened my other senses. I heard its raspy, rhythmic breathing, clearer and louder than before, such that it drowned out all other sounds, leaving the rattling of its lungs the only thing vibrating my eardrums . I felt it exhale on my feet again as it pulled itself closer to me, goosebumps springing up wherever the warm air caressed my skin, making me shudder and whimper. \\n\\nI wanted to scream. Why didn't I scream? It was almost as if I couldn't.\\n\\n**\"2.\"**\\n\\nAli's voice cut through the fearful fog surrounding me, dissipating the terror, if only for a fleeting moment, but then the horror coalesced, denser and more oppressive then before. Relief had just begun to drip into my heart like water from a leaky roof, and I had only started considering opening my eyes when I felt a hand on my leg, cold, and rough with such freakish strength the muscles on my leg constricted.\\n\\nThe patch of warmth on my skin moved upwards, from my shin to my hips to my spine, increasing in intensity as the laboured breathing became more frantic, more- excited. Then another hand on my other leg, its grip just as vice-like in strength. I was immobile, and not just from the fear. If that wasn't enough, long, flowing hair brushed against my skin, tickling the pores in my skin created by the fear induced goosebumps. Tears hung from my eyelids, and I began crying, the sobs barely above a whisper.\\n\\n**\"1.\"**\\n\\nMore flesh came into contact with mine, too much, too heavy, as if half a dozen people had been compressed into a single entity. Hands, other than the ones holding me down began caressing my arms, fondling my ears, touching my hair, my lips. \\n\\nThe stale and hot air was now on my face, flowing down from the corners of my ear to my nostril, the nauseating stench bringing fresh water to my eyes, even as the matted locks of hair lingered on my neck, raising my hackles up.\\n\\nThen Ali shouted. \\n\\n**\"Are you ready? I'm coming!!\"** \\n\\nBut the words didn't just come from Ali, whatever was lying on top of me screamed them into my ears, the voice shrill, yet guttural at the same time, the contradiction snapping me out of the daze I was in. With a sudden burst of energy, I broke free of this thing's grasp, tumbling and falling down to the floor.\\n\\nPain exploded in my left foot, I didn't know it at the time, but the awkward and sudden fall had broken multiple bones in there. The pain helped further clear the fear from my brain, finally allowing me to scream. And I screamed, and screamed till someone burst into the room, flipping the light switch on. \\n\\nI wish I could say that I didn't see anything, but for a short second there, I did, and the image is burnt into my memory, haunting my nightmares to this day. \\n\\nIt was a man, with long hair falling down his face, creating a black, shimmering veil that his glowing eyes broke through. Those bloodshot eyes, with crimson veins stretching across the eyeballs, as if stopping them from popping out; glared into my own even as the dozens of limbs spouting out of his frame writhed and contorted maddeningly. His mouth dropped open into a perfect circle, he held my gaze for a moment that seemed to stretch for an eternity, and then he was gone, disappearing with a flash as the room was blasted with light.\\n\\nThe injury immediately ended the party, and our friendship. Naturally, no one wanted to be friends with someone who sees demons in their friend's bedroom, then injures themselves, and goes on to get psychiatric treatment, a big no in Indian society.\\n\\nThe incident left a big mark on my soul, and made me question my sanity for a long time. However, in my long struggle with that trauma, I did have an odd source of comfort, letting me know that what happened was *real*. Ali's family, who had lived in that house for decades, moved out three months after that incident.\\n\\n[M](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mandahrk/)

       "3 weeks ago, a team of spec-ops was deployed to Afghanistan to investigate an old Russian complex. The team was comprised of three members. Two made it out. 1 died later of unknown causes. I was one of them.\\n\\nIt started out just as any other sortie. Get in, get out. Keep it simple. What we didn't expect was what we were after. Apparently recon had discovered an old complex, covered by sand, apparently undisturbed since it's inception. The door was bolted shut, wooden boards were nailed to the door. That didn't stop us from getting in. Marco, the demo specialist, hooked a charge to the door. An electronically detonated explosive blew through the door like tissue paper, and we made our way in.\\n\\nThe door was heavy, about 4 inches thick, but the bolt was not sturdy enough to hold. As we made our way in, something struck Henry, the combat medic in our squad, by surprise. \"Hey, you guys smell that?\" \"I don't smell anything\", Marco said, keeping focus on the open room. \" Well it smells like something rotting.\" \"Keep an eye out.\" \"Will do\", I said, keeping a mental note about the smell.\\n\\nAs we moved through the complex, a slight banging noise was heard in the ventilation, and some of the air shafts were busted open, strangely, from inside of the shafts. I caught this, and alerted Marco and Henry. Henry deduced that it could not have been done with explosives, as no shrapnel or blown out wall panels were present. Both he and I found this odd, and as we were investigating the shaft, we heard Henry shout for us, followed by gunfire. Twelve shots were fired, and we found henry huddled in the corner of the room, shaking. What was in that room defied all logic. \\n\\nBodies. There were bodies everywhere. Some were mutilated beyond all recognition, others were stripped down to the bones. One corpse was split in half, with his upper body hanging from the ceiling, his lower body was thrown onto the floor. The bodies looked to be all soldiers, twelve in total. The doors to the other rooms were covered in thick, greenish gunk, forming a sealant along the door, as proven by the corpse piled along the door, each one ripped to shreds. There was something else in that room however. A long, sand-colored, worm-like creature lie still, with multiple holes peppering it's roughly seven foot long body. Green, oily blood covered the floor around it, with Henry splattered with the blood. This was shocking. Henry was an experienced spec ops, serving some of the most harrowing, dangerous missions in the world. How could this break him? \\n\\nAs Marco was trying to get Henry to his feet, one of those things burst from the ceiling ventilation unit, grabbing Henry by the upper body, dragging him upwards. Henry flailed around, his screams muffled by the creature grabbing his body, now bringing him to the waiting maw of the worm. Marco and I opened fire, but the worm would not budge, swiftly thrashing upwards, bringing Henry with it. We stood in horror as Henry screamed, followed by six shots from his pistol, and then an audible crunch. \\n\\nMarco and I ran as fast as we could, stumbling and tripping as we bolted towards the facility door. More of those things could be heard scuttling towards us, their shrill screech echoing through the walls of the facility. As they scrambled towards us, we slammed the facility door shut, the worm's bodies slamming into the heavy metal. \\n\\n\"This is Alpha, Henry is KIA. Something took him into the vents. We can't fight them. This place needs to be destroyed. Requesting immediate evac!\" Marco had panic and fear in his voice, shouting into the radio as the worms smashed into the door.\\n\\nWe were attempting to get farther away, when the door broke open. The blockage of planks and bolt locks were the only things keeping them in. They burrowed into the sand, and vanished. We were terrified, seeing those things move with such speed through the loose sand. Marco opened fire on the mounds of sand that were now rushing towards us. I joined in, and we killed... one.\\n\\nThe beasts were unstoppable, taking multiple assault rifle shots and still going. As we scrambled backwards, one of those things grabbed Marco by the legs, attempting to drag him into the sand. Marco dumped his remaining bullets into the worm. Before it's body was riddled with holes, it sunk it's rajor sharp teeth into Marco's legs. He screamed in agony, as the wound started festering immediately. He scrambled to his feet, as did I, and we bolted farther into the desert.\\n\\nThe helo arrived about six minutes later. The soldiers onboard dropped out, but Marco protested heavily, saying they would be taken into the sand. He was losing blood fast, and I protested with him. Those things swam through sand like it was water, and they were ferocious in their hunt. We wasted no time getting out of there, lifting off as the worms lept towards to helo.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at base, we were alerted that the area was bombed. When a spec ops team like ours needed air support or reinforcements, we were put on high priority list of recovery, as our mission were vital to security. When the mission handler told us that a search team was to be sent out, I urged them not to, as those things would leave no trace of the team behind.\\n\\nI was told only today that Marco had died of his injuries, and that the infection from the bite was extreme, causing the skin to erode, and large, green lumps to form around the bite area. The only reason that I am saying this is because... I think that there are more of them out there. The Russians built that facility to study these things, and when they broke free, they sealed it off.\\n\\nMore reports have been coming in about disappearances in the Afghan mountains and deserts, with little or no trace of the victims, only half eaten corpses or shredded clothing. I'm praying now, praying that whatever these things are, they do not reach the cities of Afghanistan. They will cause untold havoc, deaths in the thousands, and they will not stop until nothing is left. I'm shipping back home to the states today, and I'm hoping that the worms do not reach another team like mine, alone, searching for documents or files.\\n\\nSomething about my transport is quite unnerving. It has been packed with samples from the site, how they got them is still a mystery, but they are on this plane. One crate is full of bodies, and I'm pretty sure that one is full of samples from the door, covered in gunk. But one crate keeps shifting, and I swear I can hear a dim scraping of sand against the steel box...

       "I walked up to the tree and stared at its stillness, wondering why it existed.\\n\\nI wasn't sure where I should put this story but I needed somewhere to store it where I could find it again.\\n\\nI had been out walking in the orchard behind my grandpa's house the previous night. I had a sleeping problem so late night walks were common. Everything just felt off that night, like something was telling me to just go home. It was a strange feeling but me being the careless person I am, I kept walking through the dark orchard.\\n\\n I found myself walking on autopilot and 15 minutes later when I looked up I didn't recognize my surroundings. I looked for the light of the house but couldn't see it, I felt frustrated at myself for having gotten lost in my mind for that long. I immediately scanned my surroundings for any landmark, nothing familiar.\\n\\n The first flash only barely caught my eye, the second one really got my attention. It appeared to be a flashing LED by a tree. I was a little confused why there would be anything other than tree's this far out in the orchard. As I walked towards it I began to notice that the tree looked a little off, the leaf's weren't blowing in the wind like the others were and it was shorter than the rest. I approached the tree and saw the flashing light attached into the tree and below the light was a small button, below the button is a label reading \"Emergency escape\".\\n\\n My curiosity getting the better of me I pressed down on the button. It didn't do anything at first, then I pressed it again with more force. I heard a *Crack* as a hatch in the tree opened up to a ladder going down a long tunnel, I couldn't see much in the dark and had to fight back the sense of curiosity that was building up. I decided I would come back tomorrow in the daylight. It wasn't long before I started to see the lights coming from that familiar porch. I opened the back door and proceeded straight to bed, feeling hit by a sudden wave of exhaustion.\\n\\nI woke up that morning, packed a bag with a flashlight, water, and a sandwich, then walked out the door. \"Where are you heading in a hurry?\" I heard a familiar voice call from behind me. I turned around to see grandpa standing in the doorframe. He looked great for being in his 70s, his hazel eyes shimmering in the morning light.\\n\\n \"I found something cool on my walk last night and wanted to check it out\" I said while walking back toward him. He took a sip of his coffee then said \"Well I won't keep you from it, stay safe and here I have been wanting to give this to you\" as he pulls out a little box from his jacket. He hands me the box, roughly the size of a mobile phone. I gave him a hug and my thanks before I opened the box and found inside the most beautiful pocket knife I had ever seen. It was engraved with my name \"Anthony Forester\" on the edge of the blade. The handle shimmered with carbon fiber patterns. I gave my grandpa a big hug, put the blade in my bag, and jogged away towards the orchard. After about 30 minutes of searching I had found the odd looking tree again, it stood there completely still like the breeze didn't affect it. I approached the hatch and got out my headlamp\\n\\nThere was a strange odor coming from the tunnel, almost sweet. I looked down and saw an endless chute going down what looked like forever. I picked up a rock resting near the tree and dropped it down the tunnel. Maybe 10 seconds go by before I hear a loud *Clang* as it echoes up. I put on my headlamp and started my way down the tunnel. \\n\\nMaybe 5 minutes goes by and as I stare down into the darkness of the tunnel, the oddness of the situation hits me. I couldn't wrap my head around why this would be here. This land had been owned by my family for generations so whatever this was it had to be extremely old. I began to see a opening of the tunnel slightly farther down. As I touch down onto the metallic floor I begin to peer around as the beam of light illuminates the room. I appeared to be in a hallway with doors lining each side.\\n\\nThe floor was a solid metallic grey, and made an echo with every step I took. I walked up to the first door on the right, it was a blue door with two words engraved on it. \"The Foresters\" it read. I guessed that maybe this was some old storage that we owned but it didn't make any sense to have it out here. I pushed down on the handle, it held firm. I tried again with more force this time, the handle went down with a click and the door creaked open.\\n\\nI stepped in and felt my world flip around. I was staring at my house, just like I had opened the front door. The T.V. was showing the news, even sunlight shown in through the windows. My brain couldn't wrap around how I was standing here. I turned around and instead of a dark hallway I was staring at my front yard. I looked back and was still staring at my living room, I did the only thing I could. \"Grandpa!\" I yelled. Nothing. I called again but got silence. I figured he had headed out to the fields and forgotten the television.\\n\\n I couldn't believe my eyes, I had been in that hallway not moments before. That's when I noticed it, there was a grey tar like substance leading up the stairs. I stopped and examined it. It smelled horrible, like something just dropped dead and rotted. It didn't look very good either, I noticed it seemed to be convulsing in a rythme almost like a heartbeat. Adrenaline taking over I grabbed the new pocket knife out of my backpack. It felt light yet sturdy, I examined it in the light for the first time. The engravement seemed to shimmer in the light.\\n\\nWith my new blade in hand I proceeded up the stairs, the stench of the tar getting stronger with each step. I began to hear an awful chewing sound once I reached the top of the staircase. It sounded like someone was chewing leather, it was the worst sound I have ever heard. I evaluated that the sound was coming from my grandpa's room, so very slowly I crept down the hallway and stopped outside his slightly ajar door. The stench was almost unbearable at this point. I slowly pushed the door open, I wish I turned around. I wish I had walked out that house and never looked back for what I saw in that room will never leave my mind. \\n\\nIt looked like a bomb had gone off, all the furniture was flung around the room. Clothes strewn across the floor, it was a disaster. Then I saw it, sitting in the corner. It had human like features but it was all wrong. Its skin was grey and it looked like it had a layer of that tar covering its body. But its worst feature by far was its face. Its eyes seemed to big for its skull, and its mouth was lined with sharp teeth. Its skin almost looked like a loosely wrapped present around his frame.\\n\\nThere I stood in the doorway of my grandpa's room watching this thing chew. Its mouth opened much wider than it should have with every chew. I watched as the tar like substance flowed from its mouth with every bite. I watched as it grabbed handfuls of clothes and broken furniture and stuffed its mouth. I ran, I ran faster than I have ever ran in my life.\\n\\nI was out the door and outside in no time at all, I didn't know where my grandpa was and I didnt care. All I could think about was getting back to that tree, back in that hallway and back inside that door. I thought I heard it chasing me but I never looked back. I don't even remember making it back down that tunnel but next thing I knew, there I was standing in front of that familiar blue door with my name engraved in it. I pushed the handle again and it opened effortlessly, I felt that familiar feeling of my world flipping and there I was holding my front door open.\\n\\nI instantly smelt bacon wafting through the house and knew that I was back. I ran into the kitchen and straight into my grandpa's arms. He had a look of confusion, \"what's gotten into you?\" He asks after I let go. I wasn't sure he would believe me so I just told him that I missed him and ran upstairs. After I got into my room I noticed I no longer had my knife. I must have dropped it in the other house, the house that felt anything but homey. As I walked towards the stairs I couldn't help but find myself lingering at grandpa's room, because I could have sworn I smelt death.



       "Hello all, my name is Henry, and recently I moved back home after my college semester had ended. I was fortunate enough to be able to move back home with my parents and enjoy the summer but the past couple of days have been particularly difficult for me and my family. I’ll start from the beginning from the first one I can remember having. \\n\\n\\nMy first premonition started when I went to the fishing pond by myself early one morning. I couldn’t wait to get there early, get a line in the water and wrestle up a nice Channel Catfish, something I’ve been dreaming of all winter. I got to the pond, set my pole up and took shelter in a nice spot of shade with my line out in the depths of the pond. A tall pine tree towered over me, leaving me tucked away in a nice little spot with the sun peering through the branches. The sun burned hot that morning and already I could feel the sweat beading on my forehead. I sat there quietly for some time, listening to the trees rustle from the slight wind, the occasional fish leaping from the water with a distinct splash and the deep ribbit of bull frogs wading in the marsh beyond the pond. \\n\\n\\nAs I gazed upon the sparkling water of the pond, the sun reflecting every ripple, every tiny disturbance on the water, the first premonition hit. It was like I was teleported into a different reality. I watched my backyard like I was in a third person perspective watching down at my dog playing along the edge of our backyard by the woods alone. Something wasn’t right, I could feel in somewhere inside me tucked away like a deep cavernous pit.  I continued watching my dog Lucky sniff the rock wall that separates our yard and a thick section of woods. Lucky snapped his head up as rustling began coming from within the woods. Soon, the hairs on Lucky’s nape were standing up and he let out a thick guttural growl. A pack of five or six coyotes jumped over the rock wall, making their whiney sounds towards Lucky. Lucky stood ground, while I begged for him to run. They stood facing each other like a western standoff, the coyotes making tiny steps closer and closer to him. The coyotes, mangy with patchy grey and dark hairs bared their teeth, with wet beads of drool dripping from their mouths. I looked on in horror as they lunged at him. Each of them taking bites and tears from him before he lay side down in a pool of his own blood while the wild animals feasted. As I watched, the dreadful feeling skyrocketed, feeling my stomach sinking, I was snapped back into my own reality with my fishing line racing off the reel. \\n\\n\\nLike a second nature I set the hook and began reeling in the fish, my mind not completely off what had just happened. I felt numb, strange as when I hook into a fish I get a bit of an adrenaline rush. I got the fish safely off the hook and back in the water rather quickly, I was focused on something else. I took some time, staring back out into the glistening water thinking about my dog. When I couldn’t calm myself down, I called my dad and asked him if Lucky was ok. Dad told me that Lucky was out back doing his business. I yelled over the phone and begged my dad to get him inside. I guess my frantic cries and pleas left my dad without much conviction. Dad called Lucky in while still on the phone with me. What he told me next sent that same dreadful feeling deep within me. He described to me as a pack of some kind of wild animals, some kind of dogs jumping out of the woods coming towards the house. Coyotes I told him deadpan, he asked how I knew that. Lucky was barking in the background I presumed at them. I told dad to keep Lucky inside and don’t let him out by himself. I hung up the phone and felt slightly better, my heart was still racing and I noticed my hand was trembling trying to hold my fishing pole. \\n\\n\\nI didn’t have much luck fishing that day, my mind was somewhere else. I was happy just to be out on the water. Taking in the fresh summer air, but I couldn’t shake that dreadful feeling. I sat by the water’s edge for some time, going over the premonition. I felt my heart start racing each time the sun reflected brightly off the water. My head began to hurt after some time, I packed up my gear and headed home. As I pulled into my driveway, still feeling that numbing sensation in my body, I looked out towards the woods where Lucky in my premonition got attacked. I focused hard and saw through the tree line. They were waiting, I could see the rises and fall of their body with each breathe they were taking. That mangy, dark and grey coat of fur and needle sharp teeth as the pack of coyotes waited in the cover of the woods. I headed inside, greeted my Lucky and my dad, not sure if I should tell him what happened at the pond. Looking back, I wish the rest of my premonitions were as simple as this one, I don’t know what to call it, fate or a warning. I just wish I was able to stop the rest of them

       "My mother used to tell me “you can always start a story with ‘It was a dark and stormy night”.  Ironically, the story I am about to tell you does not start in the dark, or in a storm, or at night for that matter. My story begins on a sunny day in the quiet, breezy woods that have become the home of legends.\\n\\nI loved hiking, it didn’t matter where, but on this particular day my wife and I were exploring the woods of northern Michigan. The sun was shining, there was a light breeze and it was just me and her doing one of our favorite past times together. We had woken up that day knowing that hiking was all we were going to do that day; our only goal was to cover as much area as we possibly could. We ate a hearty breakfast of eggs, bacon and toast, another favorite of ours. After breakfast we packed our bag with sandwiches and snacks and a few water bottles and were on the trail by 10 am.\\n\\nAs we trekked deeper into the woods, we came to a river, it was clear and the sun shining through the trees made the water gleam. This river went for a very long distance and we decided that following it was the best decision as there was no telling where we would complete our journey. By doing so we had a guide to lead us back out as well as preventing us from getting lost. We came to steep hill around 1 pm, the sun was high and warm coming through the trees, making the walk up difficult. When we reached the top we could see for miles and decided it was a good place for a rest. Just before sitting down to rest I felt a chill and looked around, it was a strange feeling, but I ignored it. Laying out a blanket we ate our lunch and just took our time soaking up the sun and feeling the little bit of breeze there was. After we finished we continued to follow the river deeper into the woods, knowing there were many secrets hidden under the vast canopy.\\n\\nThe river trickled quietly next to us as we walked in the patches of sunlight that breached the trees. We had been walking for almost two hours when I saw a large tree at the edge of the river that reminded me of the place I had proposed to my wife. I pointed to it and said “let’s sit in the shade of this tree and catch our breath.” When we were settling down for our break a broken tree branch tore open my wife’s bag. I quickly tried to patch the hole, as I didn’t want to lose anything on the hike. We sat there looking into the river for some time, when my exhaustion took over and I feel into a light sleep under the shade of that tree. When I opened my eyes I saw my wife next to me then I quickly looked at my watch. The sun was lower and over an hour had passed. Before we continued I took a long look in the clear water of the river, and noticed something. There was a strange rusty red tint to the water near the edge.\\n\\nThe hour was late so we had to move faster to complete our journey. The sunlight was now casting long shadows of the trees causing me to question the trail at times. The forest was becoming denser the deeper we got. The uneasy feeling was growing in me almost like being watched. There was no time to rest. Our haste was causing the birds to rise out of the trees and small wildlife to leave their dark hiding places under the leaves. We had walked miles and the rusty tint was still in the water, I was beginning to get worried, questioning my decision to walk next to the river. What would it mean at the end of this long walk?\\n\\nThe further we walked I started to feel like there was someone behind me watching. I said to my wife, “We need to pick up the pace!” We had already been moving fairly quickly but now we were almost at a run. As we hurried along I started to wonder “What was hiding in the dark behind us?” There was no sound and I couldn’t see movement whenever I turned around. I could feel it, feel it bearing down on me. We just kept moving. The day had started with the sun shining and the birds singing now all I could feel was the dark closing in around. This was close to carrying a weight with me. I didn’t know what to do. The hike had taken me nearly all day; I was tired and hot, hadn’t stopped for water in miles. I stumbled and fell to knees to catch my breath. I looked up and realized this was it, this was the spot. I could leave this weight right here, no more feeling that burden.\\n\\nThe sun was going down as my shovel pierced the earth where what was left of my wife would lay. With that I started my long walk back through the woods along the clear cold river.

      "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>(Night one)This started to happen when I moved out of my parents house and into a house near a lake. There have been rumors of creepy things happening at the lake but I didn&#39;t listen to any of the stories. Every night I can hear a faint voice saying <em>James</em> and it scares the shit out of me. I haven&#39;t been able to identify where the voice is coming from or what it is but something else has started happening and it gives me chills when I hear it.</p>\\n\\n<p>(Night two)My window has started to creak and it would always happen at the exact moment the voice stopped, I don&#39;t know if they are associated or if it&#39;s just wind but it scares the hell out of me. </p>\\n\\n<p>(Night three)I&#39;m starting to consider moving out because of this, most of the time when the window creaks I can feel the room get colder and I feel like someone is watching me. Now i check the window every time it creaks, i haven&#39;t seen anything happen but the voice is quieter now.</p>\\n\\n<p>(Night four)Nevermind, the voice is getting louder and there is another voice I can barely hear in the background. Tonight I have found a really creepy cellar but I&#39;m not going down there, ever.</p>\\n\\n<p>(Night five)This is the last night im going to write down for a while, but this one is going to be long. The voices are getting louder and I&#39;ve started noticing things moving, sometimes in the day I can see things that aren&#39;t there, I&#39;m scared and I don&#39;t know what to do. There have been scratching noises on the cellar door and tomorrow I&#39;m going to buy a padlock for it. This is a really long night, it feels like it will never end and I&#39;m getting worried because I can&#39;t sleep. Anytime I lay down I can hear my name being said <em>James</em>  <em>James</em> and I hate it, I need help. It&#39;s just turned to 2:30 am but I&#39;m still scared about the night going on forever, I don&#39;t know where my charger is so I can&#39;t charge my phone, I&#39;m going to conserve the battery for as long as I can. I need help now there&#39;s something scratching on my front door and I can hear it quietly say names like jill and Jay but the one thing that scared me the most was what it said next. It said <em>Jake</em>, Jake is my brother and has moved here a couple years ago, one night he didn&#39;t pick up his phone, he didn&#39;t reply to messages and when we came by nobody answered the door, his car was there but the house seemed empty. We didn&#39;t know if he was ok but a month later the news came on saying that someone had been mauled by what seemed like a bear. But I know what happened know, this thing killed him and If i don&#39;t do something soon it may kill me too.</p>\\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->

That would make sense. </p>\\n\\n<p>My dad needed a new phone, because his original phone got too small for him to use (my dad has very big hands). And it’s too small for my sisters, so he gave it to my youngest sister. She’s 9, so obviously she loved it. </p>\\n\\n<p>What he failed to tell us is that it’s very glitchy with some... apps. Sometimes it just won’t work, and sometimes it barely worked. There is still plenty of apps that do work, though.</p>\\n\\n<p>Anyway, Sera, my youngest sister, has two apps that she loves. One is some sort of character creator, and one is the kind of game where you collect adorable creatures and feed them stuff to level them up so that they can be teleported to a new area.</p>\\n\\n<p>A few months ago, she had a dream. In that dream, she was on her phone, playing on those apps. But everything froze, and those little adorable creatures just had black, soul-less eyes. A bunch of terrifying photos started glitching in, photos that a 9 year old shouldn’t EVER see, let alone exist! </p>\\n\\n<p>Before she woke up, she told me about it, but I didn’t believe her, and eventually I pretended that I did. </p>\\n\\n<p>When she woke up, she told me everything. Sera was literally holding back tears, I gave her a hug. Of course it wouldn’t fix things, but it’s the thought that counts. </p>\\n\\n<p>Weeks pass, everything seems normal. I actually forgot all about it, that is, until it happened. I don’t understand why it happened, or how, but apparently it did. Me being the foolish brat that I was, I didn’t believe her. Nobody did. </p>\\n\\n<p>I always blame myself for what happened, because everything that happened drove Sera mad. The phone is broken now, and she’s grounded. Apparently she had enough and started slamming one of my mom’s crystals into it. </p>\\n\\n<p>The lady above us on the 6th floor, she has a son, only a year older than Sera. And his electronics glitched out, too. His mom didn’t believe him, and he went kind of mad too. But instead of destroying the electronics, he became very obsessive of them. He spends all day, locked in his room, staring at the photos. Anyone that tries to interfere is sent to the hospital. </p>\\n\\n<p>I’m not sure what it could be. A demon? A spirit? I don’t even know. I feel like I should explain the photos.. because I saw it eventually. </p>\\n\\n<p>Lots of it were dead people and dead animals. Heads split open and flesh rotting, eyes either gone, or all white. Some things had worse, like a bunch of spiders, other bugs, even dolls! One doll is what set me off:</p>\\n\\n<p>It was an old baby doll, a female one too. It could blink and walk and giggle. It could be fed and it could poop.. ew. Anyway, it would be every child’s dream to have! Well, not mine, of course. The doll had one eye, and it’s mouth was wide open. It was wearing a white dress with pink dots on it. It’s head was cracked open where the hair would be. I could see some liquid, but couldn’t tell what it was. Bugs started running out of the doll’s mouths and eyes. </p>\\n\\n<p>I don’t remember going crazy, but I remember dropping my phone and having a panic attack. I couldn’t calm down. And then I blacked out. When I woke up, Sera was crying and hugging me while I sat up on the couch. What happened? </p>\\n\\n<p>What exactly did happen? I don’t remember anything. Whatever did happen, probably has something to do with that my mom’s crystal alien head is cracked open, and all of her crystals are broken. </p>\\n\\n<p>To anyone who has their child or sibling tell them something that sounds unbelievable, believe them. Protect them. Learn from my mistakes, or it’ll come back to bite you in the ass.</p>\\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->

      "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Earlier this week we moved into a small house in a very remote location. Our closest neighbors are extremely far away. So we are all alone and it gets really dark.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Original owners had a note left on the fridge that read</p>\\n\\n<p>&quot;Since you live here now, you need to follow these rules.</p>\\n\\n<p>#1: if at any point you see a red light on your wall, hide. if they find you, don&#39;t move.</p>\\n\\n<p>#2 Do NOT go into the bathrooms between 3:00 and 3:15 am.</p>\\n\\n<p>#3 keep the blinds down.</p>\\n\\n<p>#4 if you ever see a hearse slowly roll by, stay inside, if your caught outside, you need to run as deep as you can into the forest.</p>\\n\\n<p>#5 you must not leave your room door open.</p>\\n\\n<p>#6 do not go into the basement at night</p>\\n\\n<p>There is food in the fridge, and in the pantry.&quot;</p>\\n\\n<p>I was the first one to see this, being the anxious teenager I was, I showed my parents imminently.</p>\\n\\n<p>the house had the 2 bedrooms in the 2nd floor facing out to the street. During the 1st day, we spent a few hours unpacking, then we left to go get lunch. all the doors were shut as the rules say. We went to the closest food joint and had lunch. (the food joint was about 1.5 hours away)</p>\\n\\n<p>we enjoyed our meals and talked, after we ate we paid for our food and drove back.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong><em>We never should have went back.</em></strong></p>\\n\\n<p>we got back to our house, finished unpacking and ate dinner. At this point i had the rules ingrained into my brain, but i think my parents brushed them off. The first night I didn&#39;t sleep at all. After my parents went to bed, I sneaked downstairs and stole the coffee pot, some filters, a gallon of water, coffee grounds, and a cup.</p>\\n\\n<p>after watching some YouTube videos, I had to go to the bathroom Really bad. I checked the time and it read &quot;2:15&quot;. Awesome, I ran to the bathroom, forgetting to shut my door and scurried to finish my business.</p>\\n\\n<p>as i was washing my hands, it dawned on me. &quot;<strong><em>Rule Number 5 you must not leave your room door open.&quot;</em></strong> i forgot to close my door, my heart sank and i ran out of the bathroom, got to my door and stopped dead in my tracts.</p>\\n\\n<p>sitting on my bed, was a all black silhouette with crimson red eyes, staring at me. my heart dropped. It motioned for me to come into my room. Slowly i inched forwards towards my door. It smiled, revealing very sharp, yellow teeth. I was literally inches outside my room, and the figure stood up, and started making a very loud shrieking sound. it echoed through my brain. i ran downstairs almost falling, snagged the note, and ducked into a cabinet.</p>\\n\\n<p>I heard the shrieking get louder as if the Thing was sitting outside the cabinet waiting for me. On the back of the rules, was what to do if you didn&#39;t follow the rules.</p>\\n\\n<p>&quot;<strong>Only read these if absolutely necessary&quot;</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Well shit, is this necessary?!</strong> i thought to myself while scanning the back of the page.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>#1 there is no way to stop it. just let it happen.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>#2  Run outside and hide behind the tree closest to the road.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>#3 if you don&#39;t close the blinds, run into the bathroom or the basement, and stay away from windows for about 15 to 20 minutes.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>#4 if the hearse stops and the doors open tell them that &quot;you didn&#39;t mean to do the worst thing that you did, and then stand perfectly still.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>#5 if you leave your room door open, hide in a closet or cabinet until the shrieking stops.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>#6 evacuate from the house, and stay in the neighbors house.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>After reading the back side of the papers, the shrieking stopped. i slightly opened the cabinet to see the thing standing at the front door, then vanish. I booked it upstairs and shut my door and locked it.</p>\\n\\n<p>a few hours later the sun started to come up. I put the coffee pots back and slept all day. I woke up and checked my phone</p>\\n\\n<p>11:45 PM</p>\\n\\n<p>okay, round 2. i thought to myself as i grabbed the coffee stuff, and a bottle for using the bathroom, and shut the door.  5 minutes go by and i notice a red light on my wall.</p>\\n\\n<p>&quot;#1: if at any point you see a red light on your wall, hide. if they find you, don&#39;t move.&quot;</p>\\n\\n<p>I quickly ducked for under my bed and heard the sound of glass brake, followed by what sounded like 13 large boots stomping around. as i was laying flat on my back under my bed i realized that the boots had stopped, but there was still whispering. i lay there for what feels like hours but could only have been a few minutes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then my phone goes off...</p>\\n\\n<p>I imminently turn it off, and the loud boots come storming up the stairs and bust into my room. they all stand there, and start walking around chanting some different worldly stuff. i turned my head and counted the boots, 16 boots, which means there were 8 men in my room, chanting.</p>\\n\\n<p>i heard the boots run out of my room and into my parents room.</p>\\n\\n<p>I heard what was the worst thing ever.</p>\\n\\n<p>The chanting,</p>\\n\\n<p>The innocent screams of my parents,</p>\\n\\n<p>the cock of the gun,</p>\\n\\n<p>the loud bang,</p>\\n\\n<p>and then silence..</p>\\n\\n<p>for a few minutes i lay there, listening as the boots file down the stairs, and then nothing, i couldn&#39;t hear anything. i lied under my bed until the sun was up. then i hesitantly crawled out of my bed and walked downstairs.</p>\\n\\n<p>there was no broken glass, nothing had changed.</p>\\n\\n<p>but then it all came back, the gunshot, the screams of my parents, the silence.</p>\\n\\n<p>i ran up stairs and into my parents room, the door was shut, there was nothing out of the blue... strange.</p>\\n\\n<p>i open the door and wanted to throw up.</p>\\n\\n<p>my parents bed was covered in crimson red liquid. their arms and legs were all scattered about the room. their heads all mangled, tied to the fan, hanging there.</p>\\n\\n<p>it was the worst feeling of my life.</p>\\n\\n<p>(EDIT: Okay so the next part of the story is right below, but it wouldn&#39;t let me post it under the act of &quot;It was too short. so please forgive me.&quot;)</p>\\n\\n<p>I should have left after the second night and went to the police... but what would i have said to them? that some random people broke through my window, chanted while walking around, killed my parents, then left after fixing the window?</p>\\n\\n<p>I didn&#39;t end up sleeping much in the following weeks, I ate the food in the pantry and in the basement, but one thing was definitely a thought in my mind.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong><em>What if i run out of food?</em></strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Being only 13 and scared shitless, and also not being able to drive. I&#39;m Basically stuck here.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong><em>I could order uber eats.</em></strong></p>\\n\\n<p>but i don&#39;t have money.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong><em>I could use the car!</em></strong></p>\\n\\n<p>but i can&#39;t drive.</p>\\n\\n<p>I began rationing my food and resources. But being only 13, I have no idea how to pay bills. So i was eventually going to lose heat, electricity, and lights. Then what? Stuck in the middle of nowhere with no means of transportation.</p>\\n\\n<p>I began spiraling down into a very dark place... Wishing that whatever would happen, whatever is wrong with this place would just come kill me... as soon as possible.</p>\\n\\n<p>but yet, whenever I saw the hearse, the red light, left my door open. I would hide. I wouldn&#39;t let it kill me. And it pained me to sit there, wanting to end it. But when the time comes, and I had the opportunity, I Pussied out and hid.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was tired of following the rules.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was tired of life.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then it happened, I ran out of food.</p>\\n\\n<p>I scavenged out the entire house looking for food, but found nothing.<br/>\\nFeeling empty and being in the mental state I was in. I went into the bathroom, grabbed a razor and started cutting.</p>\\n\\n<p>At first, I felt the pain, but shortly after, I felt nothing.</p>\\n\\n<p>I felt <em>empty.</em></p>\\n\\n<p>Shortly after, I decided it wasn&#39;t worth it. Cleaned up my wounds, and headed off to bed. I crawled under my bed and fell asleep. I woke up to the sound of a very light tapping on my window, I figured that it was just a branch.</p>\\n\\n<p>I listened for whispering, boots, heard nothing. So I crawled out of under my bed and looked at the window. Staring back at me was a older girl, with the biggest smile I&#39;ve ever seen. She looked like she had never took a shower, or did laundry. She stopped tapping and just stared at me.</p>\\n\\n<p>and I stared back.</p>\\n\\n<p>What felt like forever, ended up only being 20 seconds. Her jaw unhinged and she fell backward head first. I jolted up and looked out the window to see nothing. My stomach was growling, but I knew there was nothing to eat.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was hungry, and was going to lose power soon...</p>\\n\\n<p>So, I went to bed.</p>\\n\\n<p>I woke up with a bad smell... It smelled like something was burning, but I didn&#39;t care. I stood in the flames and enjoyed it. bet eventually it became to much and begun to hurt. So I ran out of the house and to the other side of the street, looking back at the house I saw the girl from before, staring at the window. Angry. Then everything went black...</p>\\n\\n<p>I woke up at a hospital, the doctor didn&#39;t think I would make it. I had been hit by a car, and broken each one of my ribs.</p>\\n\\n<p>I am thankful to be out of that house, but every now and then I see the girl, Staring through my window. its been 24 years since and I started a family, but it still scars me to this day.</p>\\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s day ten. I&#39;ve shuffled about this room so many times that my footprints are starting to embed themselves into the carpet. The trash is starting to pile up. The white bags look like snow piles in the corner by the door. No flies flutter about, but I swear I hear the buzz from time to time. The door won&#39;t open. It sealed, cutting me off.</p>\\n\\n<p>The world outside is like a TV show. It&#39;s fuzzy and grimy, but people mill about on the sidewalks and in the grass, unknowing of what is going on beyond the glass behind them. The weather changes. It&#39;s raining today. No one can hear me if I scream. The windows won&#39;t break. They should, but even a chair just makes them shiver which creates the sound of thin metal being warped back and forth. It sets my teeth on edge.</p>\\n\\n<p>Food should be running out, but every few hours I hear glass shift in the fridge and new items are there. At least, I think they&#39;re new. They&#39;re the same as what was there before, but I&#39;m sure I had finished them. Maybe not. Time just doesn&#39;t seem to have meaning anymore, not since the clock on the wall stopped. I sort of miss that clock. It had to be broken though, I started to hear words in the ticks. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>Get out if there is time.</em></p>\\n\\n<p><em>Soon, it will be here, given time.</em></p>\\n\\n<p><em>You will never leave until it is time.</em></p>\\n\\n<p>I don&#39;t know if it really was talking. I know it shouldn&#39;t be able to, but... I heard it. Now it lays on top of the snow pile of garbage, its face mocking me. I don&#39;t know when it got a face. It has one now and I don&#39;t like it.</p>\\n\\n<p>The rain sounds terrible, like a thousand little feet are prancing about on every side of my apartment. I glance out the window from time to time and watch the water streak down the glass and I swear it&#39;s writing to me as well. I can see words in the lines. Words that shouldn&#39;t be there and yet, words they are.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Alone.</em></p>\\n\\n<p><em>Silent.</em></p>\\n\\n<p><em>Reborn.</em></p>\\n\\n<p>I can&#39;t wipe them away because I can&#39;t open the windows. They stare at me even while I sit here typing this. I say stare, but they&#39;re just words. Just ideas. Thoughts. Opinions from something that isn&#39;t real. I tell myself that the isolation is getting to me. I&#39;ve even resorted to porn and masturbation just to pass the time, to get some kind of release. But is it passing? My hair is longer. I feel tired and sleepy and the world outside is moving. But is it only day ten?</p>\\n\\n<p>My phone still works. I can read the texts from my boyfriend. I can read things from my little sister asking for help on something. My messages never get out. Static fills my ears when I try to call. 911 is a sing-song voice that just keeps repeating <em>&#39;Thank you for calling, we are happy to assist you in these trying times. Please hold while we transfer you.&#39;</em> It never transfers.</p>\\n\\n<p>Internet works still as well, but it acts like it&#39;s in a read-only mode. I can&#39;t post. I can&#39;t chat. I can&#39;t even upvote or downvote. Every site works, but like the windows, no one can hear or even know I&#39;ve been there. I&#39;ve watched more movies than I care to admit, but I have to keep track myself. The web apps don&#39;t seem to register when I&#39;ve watched something.</p>\\n\\n<p>Bills keep slipping in from under the door. I live in an apartment building, and have a box for mail, but someone is putting them under my door. They&#39;re all past due. Which should mean more time has passed than what I think. </p>\\n\\n<p>I&#39;m scared. I&#39;m tired. I&#39;m lonely. I think I&#39;ll go &#39;flick the bean&#39; again because I can&#39;t think straight right now.</p>\\n\\n<p>Day fifteen. Day twenty? Day five hundred? I don&#39;t know. My phone says it&#39;s only been a few hours since I last wrote something here. The save time says the same. But time has passed. I slept for a long time. I&#39;m sure of it. I don&#39;t feel well, not sick, but just wrong. Like something about my body is just misplaced. </p>\\n\\n<p>The smell from the garbage was making me gag. I&#39;ve stuffed it in a closet with a few air fresheners. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll help for long. </p>\\n\\n<p>I don&#39;t cook much anymore. The water from the sink is brown and stinks like someone had died in the well. Snack wrappers litter the living room. I sometimes get the urge to get up and clean them, but in a few hours it&#39;s back to looking the same. </p>\\n\\n<p>I’ve started to feel sick all the time. More sick than before. It&#39;s my diet. I&#39;ve gained a little weight. I can pinch my stomach now and my underwear fits differently. I don&#39;t wear pants too often. No bra either. What&#39;s the point? No one can see. No one is around to care. I&#39;m starting to smell. My scalp is itchy. I have dandruff now, never had it before. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ll have to wash myself with bottled water. If I ever decide to get up.</p>\\n\\n<p>The rain hasn&#39;t stopped. I can&#39;t make out anything outside the windows now. It&#39;s a void filled with light flares and lines. I feel like something it out there, watching. Waiting maybe. I try to draw the blinds, but they&#39;re up again a few minutes later. No noise, no movement. Just one moment they&#39;re down, and the next they&#39;re up again. </p>\\n\\n<p>The ceiling just started to leak. I&#39;ve watched the water stains grow like spider webs across the yellowing paint for a while now. The leak is by the door. I have a pan under it. The drip is maddening. I can hear it over headphones and loud music. The paint where the drip comes from is starting to bulge. It looks pregnant.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Drip.</em></p>\\n\\n<p><em>Drip.</em></p>\\n\\n<p><em>Drip.</em></p>\\n\\n<p>Day I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not sleeping in my bed anymore. I got my period and I don&#39;t have any tampons or pads. Bled like a stuck pig all over the sheets. The cramps are the worst part. My thighs are slick with blood all the time and I&#39;m running out of things to clean up with. I think I&#39;m dying. Maybe not. I sort of wish I was. </p>\\n\\n<p>The dripping isn&#39;t as bad. The bulge has grown, though. It hangs before the door, red and swollen. Something is alive inside. I can see it if I put a light up to it. Like an egg. It scares me and yet for some reason, I sort of hope that it really is something. I&#39;m still so lonely. I sometimes catch myself watching it while I eat. It should make me feel sick, but it&#39;s comforting in a way.</p>\\n\\n<p>The trash smell is coming down the hall like a summer breeze from a mass grave. Maybe it&#39;s me. I&#39;ve washed as much as I can, but a bath with a small towel isn&#39;t that helpful when you&#39;ve run out of soap and shampoo. The closet door doesn&#39;t close anymore, though. I think it&#39;s the trash.</p>\\n\\n<p>I found a maggot in my food today. It was in the package of cookies I opened. I never saw one that was covered in a red slime. I&#39;d think it was blood if I didn&#39;t have so much recent experience with it. My flow is still pretty heavy. I squished the maggot and tossed it in a trash bag. I found six more. I ate the cookies anyway. I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re good for protein.</p>\\n\\n<p>Day fuck it all. I&#39;m terrified.</p>\\n\\n<p>The bulge is gone. Just drapes of skin hang in front of the door. Blood spilled across the tile floor and had dried by the time I woke up. Whatever was inside is gone. My period has stopped, so the blood isn&#39;t from me. At least, I hope not.</p>\\n\\n<p>I hear something moving in the hallway. I sit on my couch and listen to it. Heavy footfalls move about. I have to pee, but I can&#39;t make myself stand and go look. The light in the hall flickers. I can hear discarded glass jars clang and plastic crinkle. It&#39;s in the closet with the trash. It&#39;s doing something. </p>\\n\\n<p>Whatever it is. </p>\\n\\n<p>I peed in a bottle again. I&#39;ve got a collection going now. I made a run for the bathroom when I couldn&#39;t hold back anymore. The closet door was closed. A puddle of brown muck had bled into the carpet. I stepped in it in my hurry. It smells like a swamp. When I came back out of the bathroom, the closet door was open. The trash bags were all torn apart, but mostly empty. I heard it in my bedroom. The bed springs creaked and I took off running back to the living room and shoved furniture in front of the opening.</p>\\n\\n<p>There is nowhere to go. This thing is in the apartment with me. Trapped with me. I&#39;m going to die here. I know it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Day…</p>\\n\\n<p>The furniture was moved while I slept. Black footprints led right up to the couch where I had been sleeping. My clothes are wet with the same kind of slime that had covered the maggots. Flies are starting to appear. They keep buzzing around the room, fat as nickels. Moving is hard. I feel sluggish, always tired. I don&#39;t even want to get up to clean the slime off. I can hear the thing in my apartment in the closet again. The smell in the room is gone. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve just gotten use to it. I think I&#39;ll sleep some more. If the creature wants to eat me then it can eat me and get me out of this hell.</p>\\n\\n<p>I woke to someone sitting in the chair in the living room. It was dark. I couldn&#39;t see much of anything other than the silhouette made by the flickering of the TV. It didn&#39;t move. Just sat there and watched. I also couldn&#39;t move. My legs felt like lead. I couldn&#39;t move my hips. The only part of me that still worked is my arms. Everything felt sticky. If I force myself to move pain rips through me, like I&#39;m tearing my skin away from the couch.</p>\\n\\n<p>The thing  got up and went down the hallway as I reached for the light behind me. With it on, I saw that I was tearing my skin away. My legs had fused with the couch. My hips were attached to the blanket that had laid under me. My lower half was covered in the slime, but it was now black and red. I was dissolving into the furniture. I screamed. I pulled myself free, the pain blinding, but I managed it and landed hard on the floor. I&#39;m bleeding again. More blood than I&#39;d ever seen before. I&#39;m never leaving this apartment. I know that now. It&#39;s got me. Maybe I&#39;m where I belong.</p>\\n\\n<p>The thing returned. I could see it as it entered into the room. It wore my clothes and while everything looked wrong about it, I couldn&#39;t deny that it was me. A version of me. One that wasn&#39;t stuck inside for so long. It came around the coffee table to look at me, a look of disgust on her face. She said nothing, but pulled the blanket from the back of the couch with some effort and threw it over me. </p>\\n\\n<p>&quot;Stay there. It&#39;s where you&#39;re comfortable.&quot;</p>\\n\\n<p>I choked for a moment. &quot;What are you?&quot;</p>\\n\\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m me. Who are you?&quot; She looked down at me and pushed back her hair. It was short, like mine had been. </p>\\n\\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m you,&quot; I said for lack of anything else entering my head.</p>\\n\\n<p>&quot;No. You&#39;re a part of this place now. Maybe one day you&#39;ll be reborn. When you&#39;re ready.&quot; She went to the door and pushed back the strings of flesh that hung before it. The sack was rotting. With no more effort than normal, she opened the door that had been sealed to me for what felt like forever. The door snapped closed behind her. I couldn&#39;t follow. I couldn&#39;t move. I can barely type this, but the internet is working again for some reason. Moving is still hard, painful. She was right.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/writerjpcarver/\">I&#39;m becoming part of my apartment.</a></p>\\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
      "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This story is true and it happened to me on April 2017 in Caracas, my then girlfriend now wife and I had been staying at my mother-in-law’s apartment for a few weeks because my mother’s apartment (where we lived) was being remodeled at the time. </p>\\n\\n<p>For some context, the apartment where we were staying is located on the fourth floor of a relatively small 10-floor building, which was positioned right in front of the city’s main highway.</p>\\n\\n<p>I say small because there are very tall buildings in my city, which were as tall as 40 or 50 floors and the people that lived in these buildings suffered greatly when the elevators did not work, imagine going up and down the stairs for 50 or 60 floors, that’s a lot of exercise for one day.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, there were a lot of things I had to get used to in that place, chief among them was hearing the sounds of cars, trucks, bikes, flat tires, damaged exhaust pipes and occasional gunshots that came from the poor neighborhoods that were close to my girlfriend’s home, which could be heard during the day and night. </p>\\n\\n<p>In contrast, my mother’s neighborhood was usually very quiet, especially at night, so I had to change my sleeping habits a little bit, so I usually went to bed quite late at night, usually at midnight or 1 a.m.</p>\\n\\n<p>This apartment was smaller than my apartment and it was located on a different side of the city, but I did not care about those things as long as I could get a good night’s sleep next to my wife, since I suffered from insomnia sometimes. </p>\\n\\n<p>The first time I came to my wife’s apartment, I noticed there was a small hill with a huge tree, some medium, small sized plants, bushes and patches of grass, which were right next to the highway and this seemed a little creepy to me at night. </p>\\n\\n<p>On that hill, I noticed there was a small makeshift aluminum shack, I thought that was a little funny and I thought to myself: “Well that’s weird, maybe some hobo or homeless person lives there? If he does, he must crazy to be living there”.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the first two nights I stayed there, even though I could hear the loud sounds of the highway, it took me a while to fall asleep, but fortunately everything was okay and I was able to get a good night’s sleep on those two days, but the third night as much as I wanted it to be exactly the same, it was quite different than the first. </p>\\n\\n<p>I remember it was late at night, I think it was midnight or even later, and I was almost sound asleep, I was listening to some horror stories on my cellphone to fall asleep to, just life I always did (however crazy that sounds).</p>\\n\\n<p>Suddenly, I was startled by the ear-piercing screams of some man or woman hurling a long string of F-bombs and other curses at somebody or something else, this woke me up right away and scare the hell out of me at the same time. I thought to myself: “What or who the hell was that?” and I shook my wife’s shoulder and told her: “Hey honey, did you hear that?” and she was still asleep, but responded: “Hear what? It was nothing, go back to bed honey”.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, I heard the curses again, so I decided to investigate what the heck was going on, I got up from bed, rubbed my eyes, put on my slippers and walked slowly and quietly out of our bedroom towards the balcony, where I could clearly see the highway and the small hill next to it, now I could still hear the curses more clearly and it sounded like the voice of a deranged man and I thought to myself: “Maybe I was right and there is indeed a homeless person living on that metal hut?”.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was now standing shirtless, in my boxers and slippers on the dark balcony looking to that hill, where I saw that metal hut on the first day I slept in my wife’s apartment. Weirdly enough, I was able to see a small campfire and a barefoot man coming out of the shack, who had long, disheveled hair and a long bushy beard, he was shirtless and wearing torn pants that were almost destroyed. </p>\\n\\n<p>He came out of the small shack, he was smoking a cigarette or God only knows what drug he was taking, he was standing in that hill in the dark, screaming his lungs out and cursing a lot for some reason while he was looking towards the highway.</p>\\n\\n<p>I thought that this man must be crazy, getting high or drunk enough to be yelling at passing cars or the people or dogs that were all the way on the other side of the highway, this made me feel terrified and I asked myself: “What in holy hell is that guy saying and isn’t he cold?”. </p>\\n\\n<p>Because of this racket there were some neighborhood dogs barking in this man’s direction. I thought it was really strange for someone to scream so much, especially this late at night.</p>\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately for me, my mother-in-law was a night owl like and usually slept in the living room, so she turned on the kitchen’s light out of the blue to get some water and went back to sleep, which reflected a little bit towards the balcony. </p>\\n\\n<p>I turned my head around and was a little blinded by the glare of the light, but at the same time I was scared that this man would see me staring at him.</p>\\n\\n<p>In that moment, I hid crouched below the window, so the man could not see me, but I was horrified when I saw this man walk to the fire and angrily put out the fire with his bare feet, turn his head around from the highway to look at the outer wall of the building, and all the while was still cursing out loud, I thought to myself: “Well, maybe he’s having a bad trip or something?”</p>\\n\\n<p>Suddenly, this crazy guy looked up at the building wall, he walked until he was right in front of it, he yelled: “I can’t take it anymore and the voices are driving me crazy!” and started to repeatedly bash his head into the wall until his head was bleeding, while he yelled: “Get out of my head!”, the sound it made was terrifying, when he was done he touched his head with his right hand and cleaned the blood on his chest, now he looked crazier than ever. </p>\\n\\n<p>Out of the blue, the guy looked up and noticed I was staring at him, so he yelled at me: “What the hell are you looking at? Mind your own business, you idiot!”.</p>\\n\\n<p>Therefore, I was scared to death, so I threw myself to the balcony’s ceramic floor, I winced at how cold it was and hid there for a while, I thought to myself: “Out of sight, out of mind, right?”, the crazy guy kept screaming his curses at me, I decided that was enough for me and quietly crouched back to the bed, I felt horrified about I saw and could not sleep anything that night, since all I could hear were my mother-in-law’s snores and the guys screams until 2 a.m.</p>\\n\\n<p>The next day, I felt extremely tired because I was not able to rest the night before, I told my wife about had happened, so she told me: “Yeah, at some point you get used to that crazy guy and his screams”, but she didn’t believe that the guy bashed his head into the wall and almost killed himself, so it dawned on me: “What if I can hear this guy’s screams tonight again? Should I call the cops on this guy?”.</p>\\n\\n<p>But I decided not to do it, because my country’s police are basically useless, so I still don’t know what to do about this crazy screaming man, his awful screams still give me nightmares, but I know I will never look out of the balcony window at night again…</p>\\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->

      "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>About six years ago I worked briefly as a tour guide at a historical cruise liner (1920s era), which after decommissioning from active service was turned into a floating museum and hotel. I have left the name out but it is famous for being haunted, although no one’s stories I’ve seen on TV or on the internet have been similar to mine. At the time I just tried my best to forget what I saw there, on that spring night when I decided to stay a little after closing time. When I told friends about it they did not believe me, and I have not told anyone about it for several years now. This is the first time I’ve written down what I saw.  In writing about my experience tonight I decided to add some literary flourish to try to cope with the memory because the raw image still haunts me. This is what happened:</p>\\n\\n<p>The grandfather clock struck 10, and I inhaled deeply as I sank into my favorite leather chair at the entrance of the first class lounge. Heavy wood polish and a light, lush scent of liquor filled my nose, and a fresh sea breeze blew in from the open window. It was crisp, cool, the kind of air that makes you feel invigorated, happy to be alive. I looked out the window into the night sky, listening to the ocean churn, waves lapping against the ship. I heard the muted tinking sounds of highball glasses clinking against each other behind the bar, rattled by the rocking of the vessel. The water was surprisingly rough, I had never before felt the ship move like that given its location on the dock.</p>\\n\\n<p>My eyes settled on a stained glass window separating my seat from the smoking lounge, and I watched the soft incandescent light dissipate through the segments, handcrafted by Italian artisans, true timeless quality. Little imperfections in the pane caught my eye and I studied them. I reached out and touched the surface, feeling my finger catch on it before leaving a slight fingerprint. While fixated on that little oily outline, a sudden movement behind the pane diverted my attention.</p>\\n\\n<p>“Hello?” I called out in the direction of the shadowy figure. I heard a rustle from the hallway adjacent, and felt a slight pit in my stomach. No one else should be here right now, I had said goodbye to my colleagues over an hour ago, and the only people on duty were security, who normally patrolled around the entrances. I felt palpable guilt as I thought about the repercussions if I was found here, after hours, still onboard. I would surely be fired or at the very least reprimanded as theoretically I was trespassing at this point. I crouched behind the dividing wall, perhaps they hadn’t seen me.</p>\\n\\n<p>“Wait.” A female voice cut the air, firm and authoritative, like an English aristocrat’s. I peered out from behind the wall and standing there in the smoking room, leaning against the bar was the figure of a tall, slender woman wearing a party dress, the black silk shimmering in a dazzling silhouette of beauty. She was turned away from me but I could tell she was about 25, and a fur was wrapped around her neck, a gloved hand gingerly fingering a cigarette holder, her skin a soft, almost glowing, white, like a porcelain doll. “Who are you?” I asked, straightening myself to take the scene in better, steadying myself against the wall as I did so.</p>\\n\\n<p>“You can call me Charlotte,” she said, softer this time, a hint of eroticism in her voice. “Are you always so timid around women?”</p>\\n\\n<p>“No, it’s just –-” “Just what?” She interjected curtly, raising the cigarette holder to her front, away from my view. A puff of smoke rose above her head, and she angled her head slightly towards me as if to listen, but not so much that I could see her face. “It’s just, the exhibit is closed right now, Charlotte, we aren’t supposed to be here.”</p>\\n\\n<p>“Exhibit? The whole word is an exhibit, in a way. I don’t think the world is closed, do you?”</p>\\n\\n<p>“Well, no, but this is a museum, we’re closed right now. You know, it’s the rules.”</p>\\n\\n<p>“Rules are for small-minded people, are they not? A woman like me would never fall for a man who follows…rules.” She paused before the word rules, which came out of her absolutely dripping with disdain. “Things are a lot more fun when we break the rules, wouldn’t you agree?”</p>\\n\\n<p>Her free hand gripped the side of her dress and slid it upwards revealing her bare leg, her fingers pausing as they tested the fabric. I felt a twinge of excitement, of…lust. Who is this woman? My mind raced and I felt fear. I caught her gaze in the reflection of the mirror on the side of the bar, and when I expected to see her eyes, I saw…nothing. I froze. Where her eyes should be was just flat, white colored skin under sleek ginger hair. I gasped inadvertently, the air sucked from me. She attempted to break my gaze but it was too late, she sensed somehow what I had seen.</p>\\n\\n<p>“Don’t run.” She said flatly, as cold as ice. She turned fully towards me now, and I felt pure terror as I struggled to comprehend what I saw. Her body was perfect, angelic, but her face was just nothing, like a mannekin. Her voice enunciated every syllable of her next sentence, as if it were actually being spoken by a mouth, even though it was just round, smooth skin framed by her mink fur and red curls. “I need you to do something for me, I need you to break just one, little, pesky, rule for me, just one, OK?” She said OK as if issuing a command to a dog, and she quickly closed the distance between us, gliding in an easy gait almost effortlessly until she was about 10 feet away from me. I desperately wished to avert my gaze but found I could not, my heart pounding in my chest as I stared directly into what should have been her face. I felt like I was staring into the face of death, of nothing, and the unreality of what I saw was akin to seeing a personal manifestation of an abyss.</p>\\n\\n<p>I fainted, and when I came to the lights were off, the security crew had shut everything down but hadn’t noticed me passed out in the lounge. I felt my way up and used my cell phone flashlight to exit as quickly as possible, and after slipping past security unnoticed I sent my resignation to my boss by email the next day.</p>\\n</div><!--

      "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Now I know what you&#39;re thinking.  That’s a strange thing to name a road.  Well I already know that so don’t go all Sherlock on me.  It wasn’t my choice to name it anyway.  If I did have a say in it, I would pick something more appealing… like Frying Pan Road.  Believe it or not that’s an actual Road in Colorado, and the name is priceless. I’m getting off track.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>Let me clarify that when the road was first paved, a restaurant opened up that served Maple chicken its opening night.  Well, an error occurred when the cooks didn&#39;t properly cook the food.  The dozens who ate the dead bird got food poisoning, causing them to die.  There are theories that the ghosts of the dead are the cause to road’s unexplainable events, but I’ll get to that in a second.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>First, let me introduce myself and situation.  My name is Connor, and I’m a twenty three year old male.  I first moved into this apartment when I started college since it’s the only place I can afford.  When you work at Subway, you don’t get paid much.  It’s a dreary road that always has a gray cloud above it.  The buildings look old and run down, despite all being fairly new.  The road always has a looming sense of thickness and regret, along with the stench of rotting garbage, or maybe rotting bodies.  I have yet to decipher it.  The population of the town itself is small, and shall be left unnamed for privacy reasons.  Not small enough where everyone knows each other, but small enough that if something strange happens, like a murder for example.  I’m not being hypothetical by the way.  It spreads like wild fire, and soon enough, it&#39;s the only thing the residents are talking about.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>Error Hill Road is like a small Urban legend in this town, and people make dares to come down the road and anger the spirits that haunt it.  I’m not a big fan of angering the dead, but it’s fun to stare out my cracked widow and watch the teenagers insult the spirits, only to run away with a trash can being mysteriously thrown at them.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>So now you have a bit of back story.  I’ve seen a lot of people document their personal events here on Reddit, and thought I’d take my shot at it since people seem to find it interesting to learn the details of other people’s lives.  I’m going to give a quick description myself if you don&#39;t mind.  I’m sorry if you find that boring, but I can’t stand it when stories have no descriptions.  I’m the kind of person who needs a description in order to imagine the story, or else I’ll just imagine a humanoid blob floating around as the main character.  I can’t concoct a new human being in my head, since you could look like a crossover between John Cena and Morgan Freeman for all I know.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>I’m a fairly tall guy, with light brown hair and brown eyes who people say look dead.  I’ve never thought of it as a compliment or insult since I do tend to appear to have a poker face the majority of the time.  Unintentionally of course.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>So now that all that is out of the way, let me enlighten you about the story you came to hear.  I live on a road called Error Hill Road, and since I moved here, a lot things happen with no logical explanation.  It’s the perfect plot to a horror movie I know.  I’m not keen on the events, although I don’t feel as scared of this place like when I first moved in.  More unnerved, and wishing it’ll all stop soon.  Things like unintelligible whispers in the night under my bed, and my neighbor&#39;s dog howling demoniacally at ungodly hours.  Although no one in this apartment owns a dog…  My neighbor does own a small turtle she named William Shellspeare, like Shakespeare for all you non intellectuals.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>My Landlord, Cedar Haywood, is an eccentric old man obsessed with the decade of 70’s and 80’s.  Every time you see him, he’s decked out in an opened chest glitter shirt, and bell bottom pants.  He tried to salvage his remaining strands of gray hair and curl them.  Except it only looks like frayed fishing wires.  I asked him about the strange sounds when I first moved in, since I was a tired college student and couldn&#39;t sleep with all the scratching at my window and whisperers telling me about my inevitable fate.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>He said it was probably just the grasshoppers.  We get a lot of those around here.  Big buggers is what they are.  At least five inches long and always have an attitude.  I knew it wasn’t them though since they couldn’t whisper, just chirp obnoxiously and feed on you if you aren’t paying attention.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>“Eh, don’ worry &#39;bout it Connor, them grasshoppers love playin’ around when you’re asleep.”  Mr. Haywood said, brushing off his sparkling pants and going back to working on his computer.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>I just want to sleep without hearing howling at my window sill, and feel that slimy hand that reaches for me under my bed more often than not.  These things went on for a while, and slowly progressed.  Words would appear on my bathroom mirror like, “You’re next.”  And, “Your days are numbered.”  Nothing a little Windex couldn’t fix.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>I love to take evening strolls, and sometimes building doors would swing open suddenly.  I would often see figures lurking in the shadows of the darkened alleyways.  It never failed to make my heart drop into my stomach, but pretending I didn&#39;t just see a toothy yellow smile from the alleyway adjacent to me on my walk made me feel better than convincing myself what I saw was real.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>It wasn’t until recently did the events become more hard to ignore.  Mostly because of the murders that have happened recently.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>I got a call from my neighbor Mrs. Bamford.  She was a sweet old lady who loved to knit me clothing items.  I got mostly scarves and a certain type of clothing I couldn&#39;t identify.  I think it was hand muffs?  I don’t know, it had five fist size holes in it though, and I ended up using it to hold my phone while it charged.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>She said she wanted to know if she could borrow my Star Wars DVD collection.  (The 1977 version, not the 2015 one.  The newer one tried too hard, and the only good thing about it was BB8.  Don’t start witch hunting me in the comments, I have the right to an opinion.)  She wanted to impress her recent boyfriend she met on a website for older nerdy people, and have a movie marathon with him that night.  I said yes and rummaged through my messy apartment to find it.  I moved the dirty, animal like bones that would appear in random places constantly to find the DVD.  The bones were normally small, and covered in blood and grime.  They became too much after a while, and Mr. Haywood would do nothing about the problem.  So I began to pile them in the corner of my room as evidence if I ever got the chance to report the problem to someone who was willing to help.  Eventually through the scattered mess of bones and dirty clothing, I found the dusted box set and went to deliver it to my neighbor.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>But when I knocked on her door and got no answer, I decided to just walk in.  I wasn’t expecting to see her body on the floor.  “Hey Ms. Bamford?”  I asked, putting the DVD set down on the coffee table to figure out why she would take a nap in such a strange area on the floor.  If I was her, I would have at least picked the place next to the couch, it’s always more comfortable there.  I leaned down to check her pulse.  Yep.  She was a goner.  I noticed a strange mark on her neck that looked like a tiny hole had been drilled into it, and bits of green goop oozed out sickeningly from it.  Maybe she had a disease.  That made me worried since I didn’t want to catch whatever had and expect a similar fate.  I had heard too many corona virus stories and didn’t feel exactly safe.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>I contemplated calling the police, but it wasn’t my business as to why she decided to drop dead before her Star Wars movie marathon.  Although the more I thought about it, the more I realized that she probably didn&#39;t die on purpose.  So I picked up her phone and dialed the number to the police.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>As I suspected, it took a while since the police in this town don’t care too much about the citizens they protect.  After a while of waiting and trying to shoo off the giant grasshoppers that kept getting in through the cracked window, the police arrived.  They asked me what I knew about Ms. Bamford, and what happened.  Apparently the cause of death was a sudden heart attack, although that doesn’t really explain the green mark I saw on her neck.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>“Hey Connor!”  My neighbor Sage came out of the apartment and watched the police take the body out of the building.  “Another one dead huh?”  She asked lightheartedly, staring disappointingly at the body.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>“Yeah, but at least she was old.”  I said.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>Recently, seeing a body being taken out of the building wasn’t too uncommon.  Whether the body was being taken out by police, or the weird lingering shadow figure that tends to appear on Friday nights.</p>\\n\\n<p>“Too bad she was sweet.  She always made me weird clothing.”</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>“Oh she did that for you too?”  I asked surprised, looking over at her.  Sage was a young girl around my age, who constantly dressed like an emo Barbie doll, and had a weird fascination with Monster high.  She had short hair with the tips dyed green, and exuberant eyes that were always lit up with a childishly happy tone of voice.  She was the one that owned the turtle named William, and I would frequently hear old 2000’s cartoon theme songs blaring from her apartment.  It didn’t bother me too much since it was a good distraction from the howling and scratching outside my bedroom window.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>“Yeah, she was always making stuff for her neighbors.  Hope the next tenant doesn&#39;t have a tropical disease like the last one did.”  She commented, heading back to her apartment.  “See ya later Connor!’  I waved goodbye to her when I felt a hand on my shoulder.  I turned around to see one of the officers staring down at me.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>“Hey Connor, I want to ask you something.  You do realize you were the last person who ever talked to  Ms. Bamford alive right?”</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>I looked at him unblinkingly.  “Yeah I know.  What’s your point?”</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>“My point is, is that because of you being the last one to talk to her, we can easily rule you as a suspect.”</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>“I highly doubt that.”  I said with casualness in my tone.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>“And how so?”</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>“Because I had no motive to kill her, plus it’s her business why she had a heart attack.  I doubt I could have caused her death if it was by natural accord.”</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>“You have a point, but we still need to get a bit more information out of you.  We found a strange mark on her neck and to need know if anyone can explain it.”</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>I wasn’t expecting the officers to be suspicious with me, but my luck always seems to be against me.  It’s currently 11:05 P.M.  I’m so supposed to go in for questioning tomorrow, so I’ll update you guys when I get the chance.  In the mean time, farewell.  I have to tell the whispering under my bed to shut up so I can wake up for work on time.  Those sandwiches aren’t going to make themselves.</p>\\n\\n<p>(Part 2)[<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fjlyb3/the_mysteries_and_murders_of_error_hill_road_part/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fjlyb3/the_mysteries_and_murders_of_error_hill_road_part/</a>]</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>(Part 3)  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fk9sch/the_mysteries_and_murders_and_error_hill_road/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fk9sch/the_mysteries_and_murders_and_error_hill_road/</a> </p>\\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->    1\n",

My job is basically ensuring my Squadrons spend their money each year efficiently and legally. Nothing like what I thought I would be doing in the military but hey, it&#39;s good money and the benefits are great. But with this whole COVID-19 Non sense, I some how fell into the &quot;Essential&quot; category so I&#39;ve been reporting to work as normal since March. Super annoying but oh well, it&#39;s the hand I&#39;ve been dealt.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was at my previous location for 8+ years and pretty well known around the base and the &quot;go to guy&quot; for my career field. To be honest, I&#39;ve just been cruising down easy street for the time I&#39;ve been here. With time on station, comes seniority and just general know how to get the mission accomplished. I rarely stressed about work nor did we ever do some world altering missions at my last base. That all changed drastically the past few months.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was at work running an analysis on how much we&#39;ve been spending on COVID-19 response when I got a unknown call on my desk phone. I thought to myself, &quot;Hmm this is weird&quot; but I answered anyway. Normally the initial greeting is, &quot;This is (Rank/Name from X Squadron)&quot; but not this time. The chick on the other side of the phone spoke clearly and directly, &quot;Sgt Mack, you&#39;ve been hand picked to join our research team in the newly established United States Space Force. Is this something that may interest you?&quot; Of course I was like &quot;What the fuck? This has to be a joke.&quot; After a few minutes I realized it wasn&#39;t and I nervously agreed. She was very adamant about how I was highly sought after and with my experience in the job that they needed me there ASAP. I tried pressing for more answers to the plethora of questions I had but all she could say was it was a great opportunity and the promotion rate was extremely faced paced (That one statement is what suckered me in as only have a few years left to retirement. More rank = bigger retirement check). </p>\\n\\n<p>Fast forward 2 months and I&#39;m buried deep in a bunker not allowed to tell anyone what I am doing or why they needed me there. But I am here to warn yall what were really doing isn&#39;t working nor are we safe. </p>\\n\\n<p>They tasked me with basically &quot;covering up&quot; purchases to show that we are buying facility sustainment equipment but we are building a legit fucking Death Star style weapon. We are pulling in so many crews and engineers daily that it&#39;s hard to keep count and they are all working in this mountain preparing. At first I was like &quot;Ok, no worries. New military branch, new objective.&quot; But when I started researching what I was actually buying I got concerned. So I may or may not have slipped into an Intel brief and god do I wish I would have not done that. </p>\\n\\n<p>I&#39;m sure most of you saw where the US admitted to UFOs being real, but what you dont realize is those aircraft weren&#39;t stopping in for a visit, they were evacuating. We&#39;ve been harboring intergalactic refugees since the Roosevelt Presidency and they have all left in a panic. We finally found out why. During the briefing they covered how the radio disturbances we had been receiving for the past few years weren&#39;t actually disturbances but a message. The scientists were able to pin point the transmission source from a &quot;comet&quot; about 3 light years away but the more digging they did the more they were able to prove it wasn&#39;t a comet but yet a vessel. These disturbances have been occurring for over 20 years and now they have been happening almost daily. A couple of the intel guys started recognizing a pattern in the radio waves and made a crude deciphering of what they are transmitting;</p>\\n\\n<p>&quot;The Human Project has failed.

      "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My parents were murderers, I don’t know the whole story because I have made the conscious decision to avoid any media related to my parents, but it was an experience that shaped my entire life. </p>\\n\\n<p>Growing up, I was told that my house was a bed and breakfast, people would come and go, though, I would never see them go myself. People walking in and out at all hours just became a fact of life. I wouldn’t question it, I just assumed it was normal. </p>\\n\\n<p>Now, like I said before, I don’t know the entire story behind my parent’s spree, but I do know what their method of killing was, because I heard it. One night, after I was instructed to go to bed early because I had refused to eat my broccoli, three sounds shot up through the vent and into my room. You see, my room was directly over the living room, and the living room was directly over the basement, so, if something loud enough happened in the basement, it could carry to my room. Now, I’m not sure if this was the only time I heard my parents kill because they assumed I fell asleep early or what, but I can tell you, those sounds have shoved themselves into my mind. No amount of therapy has dislodged them.</p>\\n\\n<p>First, the sound of my father’s table saw in the basement turned on, then, a cry for help. It wasn’t exactly verbalized, but picture the scream you would make if you were trapped in the wilderness, and with all options out the window, you just decide to scream. Yeah, that kind of sound. Finally, the sound of what I can only describe as “a slab of meat being shredded to ribbons”. The squelching, wet rips, and crack of bone are all still very fresh in my mind. I remember freezing in bed, unsure of what I had just heard. I mean, is an eight year old supposed to know what a human torso being thrown onto a table saw sounds like? Sorry for just putting my head under the covers and drifting off to sleep! If I could go back and help, I would have, but I didn’t. </p>\\n\\n<p>I was fourteen when my parents were caught by the police. I was at school when they raided my house, but with the kicked in door, multiple holes in walls, and shattered furniture, I imagine they didn’t go quietly. My uncle, who I moved in with, tried shielding me from what came out in the trials, but some facts slipped through the cracks at the time, and others I’ve discovered during late night drunken google search rabbit holes. </p>\\n\\n<p>My parents began killing in 1998, when I was six, they were charged with fifteen murders, but the number possibly stretches to twenty. Both were given life without a chance for parole. I won’t give the names that the media bestowed upon them, because it could lead back to me, but no nickname could strike fear in me more than what they truly are to me, “Mom and Dad”. </p>\\n\\n<p>I know this kind of seems random to throw on here, and it actually was. You see, the reason I decided to put my story out there was because I was going through old family photos yesterday, out of work and bored out of my mind. A lot of them were completely normal, vacations, Christmas pictures, family gatherings, but one picture sparked every possible memory I had relating to their killings. </p>\\n\\n<p>It’s Fourth of July, 1999, my father had asked my uncle to take a picture of the three of us in our foyer, just as everyone was leaving. I wasn’t completely sure, so I had to really put the picture right up to my face. If you look closely at the cream colored heels my mother is wearing, specks of what are unmistakably dried blood, coat the very bottom of the heel. </p>\\n\\n<p>I’m not sure what I’m going to do with the picture, leaning towards burning it.</p>\\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->

      "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, My name is Sarah,</p>\\n\\n<p>And I&#39;ve been a 911 Operator and Police Dispatcher for the Chicago PD For 16-years.</p>\\n\\n<p>Being a 911 OP or any Dispatcher for that matter, is one of <strong>the</strong> most <strong>stressful</strong> yet rewarding jobs you will ever do. People&#39;s lives revolve around how fast you can get help to them. And you must be a god at multi-tasking (Just wanted to say that to any of those who are considering this career path.)</p>\\n\\n<p>You know all those paranormal spooky click-bait YouTube videos where it&#39;s like &quot;TOP 10 MOST TERRIFYING 911 CALLS YOU WILL EVER HEAR!&quot;</p>\\n\\n<p>Yeah, those are 1-in-a-Million for any dispatcher. But if you&#39;re &quot;Lucky&quot; to get them, you&#39;ll be the talk of break-room discussions for weeks.</p>\\n\\n<p>Why am I bringing this up? You might be asking.</p>\\n\\n<p>Because I was &quot;Lucky&quot; Enough to get one of these calls. What started out as a simple ordinary call transformed into one of <strong>the</strong> most F&#39;d-Up calls I&#39;ve ever gotten. I was able to get myself a transcript, that&#39;s what I will have below. Some things like Private info have been removed because, you know, laws &#39;n stuff.</p>\\n\\n<p>{OP} Chicago Emergency, Do you need Police, Fire, or Ambulance?</p>\\n\\n<p>{CALLER} Police!</p>\\n\\n<p>{OP} One moment mam.</p>\\n\\n<p>CALL TRANSFERRED TO OPERATOR #16</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} Chicago Police what&#39;s the address of your emergency?</p>\\n\\n<p>{CALLER} Yeah! There&#39;s a woman, crazy-ass bitch down the hall.</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} Mam, what&#39;s your address?</p>\\n\\n<p>{CALLER} [Address Redacted]</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} . . . Ok so it&#39;s [Address Redacted]?</p>\\n\\n<p>{CALLER} Yeah I need some fuckin&#39; Police now.</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} What&#39;s going on there mam?</p>\\n\\n<p>{CALLER} So there&#39;s this crazy-ass bitch who lives down in the apartment 3 doors down.</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} What Apartment is that?</p>\\n\\n<p>{CALLER} Yeah it&#39;s 223, she lives in 226, but can you get some...</p>\\n\\n<p>*<em>AUDIBLE GUNSHOT\\</em>*</p>\\n\\n<p>{CALLER}: Oh... Shit, hold on a sec.</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} Mam, stay on the line with me.</p>\\n\\n<p>. . .</p>\\n\\n<p>. . .</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} Mam?</p>\\n\\n<p>{CALLER}: Who in &#39;da hell?</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>-----------------------</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>And just like that, the line cut-off. So I was confused to all hell, and decided to dispatch someone out there. Below is a transcript of that.</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} Dispatch, Adam-223</p>\\n\\n<p>{ADAM-223} Go ahead.</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} We have a possible domestic at [Address Redacted], Apartment 226 in the [Neighborhood Redacted]. Possible Shots-Fired, respond Code-3</p>\\n\\n<p>{ADAM-223} 10-4 in route.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>-----------------------</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>I hear on the radio a minute or two later he arrives and is gonna check it out</p>\\n\\n<p>So, about 15 minutes later, I&#39;m in the middle of dispatching people to a road-rage incident when I hear <em>this.</em></p>\\n\\n<p>{ADAM-223} ADAM 223! SHOTS- FUUU-</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} A-Adam 223 Say again</p>\\n\\n<p>Nothing. So I&#39;m internally freaking out as now everyone on the channel just heard what sounded like this officer swallowing his radio.</p>\\n\\n<p>And now I&#39;m massively freaking out, so we get about every cop in the area to respond and the street is locked off.</p>\\n\\n<p>That&#39;s when this happens</p>\\n\\n<p>{DAVID-16} David-16, Dispatch.</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} Go ahead.</p>\\n\\n<p>{DAVID-16} We need Medical down here, Officer down.</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} 10-4 Medical in route.</p>\\n\\n<p>{DAVID-16) Dispatch there&#39;s a cannon at the-</p>\\n\\n<p><em>\\</em>UNKNOWN AUDIBLE SOUND**</p>\\n\\n<p>{ME} David-16 Say again?</p>\\n\\n<p>Nothing, again.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>-----------------------</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>At <em>this</em> point, we have every officer in the goddamn universe at this apartment complex, and a few more officers head upstairs. At this point, this is where my obtainment of transcripts stop. I tried.</p>\\n\\n<p>So 3 Officers head up into the hallway, and they tell me that the officer (David-16) Is laying on the floor, his hands on his face.</p>\\n\\n<p>All of sudden while in the middle of his sentence, someone screams &quot;HOLY SHIT WATCH IT!&quot;</p>\\n\\n<p>And the dude on the radio is struck by something, but it doesn&#39;t disconnect right away, as his button is still on the pager.</p>\\n\\n<p>&quot;Fuck... I&#39;m...&quot;</p>\\n\\n<p>And the radio drops.</p>\\n\\n<p>The 2 (Remaining) Officers explain that a massive spike just swung from the ceiling through a removed roof panel. And the officer was impaled and pinned on a roof tile. They then explain that this entire floor is rigged with traps and they need to leave. So they do.</p>\\n\\n<p>Eventually we get SWAT, and they enter the apartment to find a young woman with a gunshot to the head.</p>\\n\\n<p>Apparently she was a Schizophrenic woman who was staying at a house with her sister giving her medication, we she suddenly left during the night, and went on the run. She ended up thinking that all police were demon worshipers that needed to be killed</p>\\n\\n<p>So she staged a domestic and the 911 caller was mistaken for an officer, she was shot by the woman at close range. The first officer was gunned down,</p>\\n\\n<p>The 2nd was impaled in the head with a spear hooked up to a cannon she set up next to hear door.</p>\\n\\n<p>I already explained the 3rd.</p>\\n\\n<p>If anymore info comes to light I&#39;ll update it here.</p>\\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->
